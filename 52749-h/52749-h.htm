<p class='c007'>We must now return to the north and witness the final
struggle which was to begin the Japanese retreat from the
whole north. It was not till long after the fifty days had expired
that Gen. Sim Yu-gyŭng returned from Nanking. The
Japanese had sent time and again, asking why he did not make
his appearance, but now on the sixth day of the twelfth moon
he entered the city of P’yŭng-yang, making no excuses for
his tardiness but delivering his message as follows: “I have
seen the Emperor and he says that if you wish to become
vassals of China you must first give up all the territory taken
from Korea. You must also give up the two princes whom
you have captured. If you do not see fit to comply with these
demands the Emperor will send a million men and destroy
you.” He then gave to each of the Japanese leaders an ornament
for the hat, from the Emperor. This was a trick to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>discover how large the Japanese force might be. It was determined
that there must be about 20,000 Japanese troops in
the city. What reply the Japanese gave to the Emperor’s
demands is not told, but that it was a negative one seems sure
from what followed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chinese army of counter-invasion lay just beyond
the Ya-lu River. It was an enormous host and, as armies went
in those days, it was a thoroughly efficient one. In connection
with this army was an official who held the rank of
“Military Adviser,” by the name of Song Eung-ch’ang. The
office carried no active power in the field but it seems to have
been a sort of check upon the commander-in-chief, for the
duties of the office were to keep the Emperor informed of
what was going on at the seat of war. The actual General-in-chief
was Yi Yŭ-song. Under him were three generals, of
the right, left and center respectively. The General of the
Left was Yang Wŭn and under him were Generals Wang Yŭ-jung,
Yi Yŭ-mă, Yi Yo-o, Yang So, Sa <a id='corr2.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Ta-su'>Tă-su</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_2.18'>Tă-su</a></span>, Son Su-ryŭm,
Yi Ryŭng and Kal Pong-ha. The General of the Center was Yi
Yŭ-băk and under him were Generals Im Cha-yang, Yi Pang-jin,
Ko Ch’ak, Chön Sŭ-jong, Ch’ŭk Keum, Chu Hong-mo,
Pang Si-whi, Ko Seung and Wang Mun. The General of
the Right was Chang Se-jak and under him were Generals
Cho Seung-hun, O Yu-ch’ung, Wang P’il-jŭk, Cho Chi-mok,
Chang Eung-ch’ung, Nak Sang-ji, Chin Pang-ch’ŭl, Kok Su
and Yang Sim. The rear guard was under the command of
Gen. Pang Si-ch’an and the engineering corps was commanded
by Generals Yu Whang-sang and Wŭn Whang. The
main army was composed of 43,000 troops, while in the rear
was a reserve force of 8,000. This army crossed the Ya-lu
on the twenty-fifth of the twelfth moon, the dead of winter.
It is said that when on the march this army stretched along
the road a thousand li (three hundred miles and more) and
that the sound of their drums was continuous along the whole
line.</p>

<p class='c000'>General-in-chief Yi Yŭ-song, dressed in crimson robes
and riding in a crimson chair, arrived in Eui-ju and immediately
sought an interview with the king. The latter said, “I
have governed this country badly. The Emperor has been
put to a great deal of trouble on my account and all these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>good men have come a long, cold road to fight for us. Though
I lay open my vitals with a sword I cannot repay you all for
this kindness.” Gen. Yi smiled and said, “The Emperor’s
might reaches to the heavens. For the sake of Your Majesty’s
happiness we have been sent, and all your enemies will soon
be put to flight.” To this the king rejoined, “Our nation’s
life hangs by a thread, and the result lies with you.” Gen.
Yi raised his two hands in salute and answered, “I am come
at the Emperor’s orders and life or death are all one to me.
When I started out my father said to me, ‘Fight valiantly
for Korea and return victorious,’ and so how can I do less
than my best?” The Koreans say that this man’s father was
a native of Eun-san in the province of P’yŭng-an, Korea, but
that for some offence he had fled to China and together with
many of his relatives was enjoying high position under the
Emperor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gen. Yi started for P’yŭng-yang with his whole army,
80,000 bags of rice and 20,000 pounds of powder. His troops
were not provided with muskets but they had small cannon.
The Japanese on the other hand had muskets but no cannon.
Upon the arrival of the Chinese at An-ju they were met by
the Prime Minister, Yu Sŭng-nyŭng, who laid before Gen. Yi a
map showing the roads leading to P’yŭng-yang. Gen. Yi took
red ink and indicated on the map the various routes by which
he intended to lead his forces to that city. Calling Gen. Sa
Tă-su he sent him forward to deceive the Japanese by saying
that a few Chinese had come to effect a peaceful solution of
the difficulty. The Japanese were pleased at this and sent
twenty of their people to meet, as they supposed, Sim Yu-gyŭng
at Su-an. Gen. Sa feasted them there but meanwhile
had the place surrounded and in the midst of the banquet the
Japanese were treacherously assaulted and cut down, only
three escaping. From these the Japanese learned of the hostile
intentions of the Chinese and were greatly disturbed, but
being forewarned they put themselves in readiness for an
assault.</p>

<p class='c000'>And so the old year died—the terrible Im-jin year which
witnessed the indescribable horrors of the ruthless invasion
which swept it from end to end; which saw, too, the gradual
awakening of the dormant military spirit of the people, until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>at its close the wave of invasion had not only broken and spent
itself but had left the remnant of the invaders cut off from
their home land by one of the greatest naval geniuses of his
own or any other age, surrounded on all sides and hemmed in
by forces which though perhaps unable to cope with them in
the open field in a pitched battle could yet <a id='corr4.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>harrass</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_4.6'>harrass</a></span> and cut
them off on every side. It must be clearly borne in mind that
the Chinese did not raise a hand to help Korea until the invasion
virtually collapsed. The Koreans without the aid of
China could probably have starved the Japanese out of P‘yŭng-yang
and driven them southward, cutting them off on the left
and right till they would have been glad to take ship for home.
In a sense the Chinese counter-invasion was an extremely unfortunate
thing for Korea, for the dormant energies of the people
were just rousing themselves to action. Armies were being
levied, every day saw the Japanese forces melting away
and there was a magnificent opportunity for Korea to turn
upon her devastators and drive them headlong into the sea.
It would have given a tremendous impulse to patriotism and
national self-respect, and it might have been a stepping-stone
to a strong national life; but the coming of the Chinese soldiery
immediately threw everything into Chinese hands and
they reaped all the benefits of the situation. Even the Koreans
themselves did not realize how they were playing into
the hands of China. The Japanese in P‘yŭng-yang were
weary and sick, and at heart glad of any excuse for retreating
if it could be done without too great a loss of dignity. It was
at just this moment that the Koreans put the game, already
won, into the hands of China to reap all the credit and all the
prizes of success. The Koreans leaned back upon China and
relapsed into their old self-complacent “fool’s paradise.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With the beginning of the new year Gen Yi moved
southward toward P‘yŭng-yang as far as Suk-ch‘ŭn where he
intended to halt for the night, as the winter days were short,
but hearing of the massacre at Sun-an and wishing to give as
little time for preparation as possible, pushed on by night, and
in the morning planted his banners before the ancient city of
P‘yŭng-yang. The city was forthwith surrounded. The
Japanese could be seen covering the slope of the hill within
the wall with their blue and white flags, and soon they opened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>fire on the besiegers. At the same moment they rushed to
the walls and manned them. The Chinese Generals of the
Left, Center and Right were stationed with their respective
forces before the three gates Ch’il-sŭng, Ham-gu and Po-t’ong.
The General-in-chief Yi, with a banner in one hand and a
drum-stick in the other, rode swiftly from one division to another
encouraging the men. His forces could hardly be held
in check, they were so eager, in spite of their long, cold night
march, to rush at the wall and scale it. They were not long
kept from their desire, for at eight o’clock word was given for
the whole assaulting force to advance to the wall. The cannon
thundered, the fire-arrows flashed <a id='corr5.12'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='throught'>through</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_5.12'>through</a></span> the air, the
very ground fairly trembled with the noise of battle and the
tramp of eager feet. One of the fire-arrows alighted in the
quarters of the Japanese general-in-chief and it was soon in
flames, which rapidly spread to all the surrounding buildings.
The Japanese guarded the walls with the greatest gallantry,
and with spear and arrow, hot water and stones they made it
quite impossible for the Chinese to effect an entrance. The
wall bristled with weapons, so that in the words of a native
chronicler it was “a hedge-hog’s back.” So it happened
that the Chinese forces fell back from the fierce defense of the
Japanese. Many of them contemplated a general retreat and
started to leave the field, but Gen. Yi, who was always found
where most needed, saw the defection of his men and, pursuing
them, struck off the heads of a few as an example to the rest.
Then he turned and cried, “Fifty ounces of silver to the first
man to set foot upon the battlements of P’yŭng-yang.” This
was doubtless a more powerful appeal than he could have made
had he called upon their patriotism or love of glory. Immediately
the tide of battle turned. A Chinese captain, Nak
Sang-ji, a man well along in years and whose proportions
were so ample that the Korean chronicler says of him that he
weighed a thousand pounds, led on a company of men and by
a mighty effort succeeded in reaching the top of the wall. He
held his ground there while others could scale the wall at his
back, and so an entrance was effected. The Japanese began
to desert the wall, and soon the Chinese entered by the Po-t’ong
and Ch’il-sŭng gates, while Korean allies entered by
the Ham-gu Gate. By this time the Japanese had entirely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>left the wall and had massed themselves as best they could
in various parts of the city, determined to make a desperate
stand. The Chinese infantry and cavalry both swarmed in
on every side and all Japanese stragglers were cut off, while
the fight throughout the city became general. Before the
Japanese could firmly establish themselves upon the hill and
in other defensible parts of the town they lost two captains,
2,285 men, and 45,002 weapons of various kinds, besides
1,051 Koreans whom they had held as captives.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many of the Japanese had taken refuge in various government
buildings which they had barricaded as best they
could. The Chinese went to work systematically to burn
these down, and in the few hours remaining before the fall
of night nearly half of the entire Japanese force succumbed
to the weapons of Chinese. One instance will suffice to illustrate
the method of procedure. Many of the Japanese had
taken refuge in a large building on the wall, well up on
the side of the mountain and looking directly down upon
the waters of the river. Gen. Yi had it surrounded with
piles of wood, the timbers of houses and hewn logs, and these
were set on fire. The entrapped Japanese then had the
choice of roasting to death or leaping down upon the ice of
the river. Hundreds chose the latter alternative, but the ice
was not strong enough to stand the tremendous strain and
they were all engulfed in the river and carried under the ice
below. As for those that remained, it is said that the smell
of burning flesh could be discerned a quarter of a mile away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gen. Konishi had taken refuge with a large body of troops
in a building called the Yŭn-gwang-jŭng, very near the Ta-dong
Gate which opens directly upon the water front. Night
had fallen and the fight had lulled for a time. What took
place at this time may be open to some doubt. The Korean
account says that the Chinese commander sent a message to
Konishi demanding the surrender of his whole force and that
Konishi replied, “Our remaining force is small and we wish
to evacuate the city and retreat if we may be allowed to leave
quietly.” It is affirmed that Gen. Yi consented to this and
left the Ta-dong Gate unguarded, and in the dead of night
the Japanese troops passed swiftly out and crossed the river.
On the face of it this statement is hardly credible, but judging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>from future events the Koreans believe that Gen. Yi received
a large bribe from the Japanese as the price of this act of
leniency. It is true that future events justified the Koreans
in suspecting some such thing, but as the Japanese were immediately
beside the Ta-dong Gate and, under cover of night,
might easily have forced their way out, especially as the Chinese
were exhausted by their long forced march and the fight
about the city, we may well believe that the Japanese did not
need to appeal either to the pity or the avarice of the Chinese
in order to effect their escape. It may be, too, that Gen. Yi
did not wish to be hampered with so many prisoners of war
and was rather glad than otherwise to let them get away. Of
course the Koreans who had suffered so terribly at the hands
of the Japanese would have been glad to see every one of them
massacred, and their anger at seeing them escape may have
led them to impute wrong motives to Gen. Yi. Subsequent
events, however, gave some color to these suspicious, as
we shall see.</p>

<p class='c000'>This retreat from P’yŭng-yang in the dead of winter was
like Napoleon’s retreat from Moscow, on a small scale. The
Japanese were without provisions or proper clothing. Many
of them threw aside their arms and luggage and, turning from
the main road, begged their way from house to house. When
at last they reached the city of Seoul and found food and safety
they were in a savage humor. Most of the Koreans who
had fled from the capital had now returned, and on them these
half-famished and wholly disappointed Japanese wreaked their
vengeance. They seized hundreds of the unoffending people
and put them to the sword. Scores of them were taken outside
the South Gate and slaughtered like oxen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gen. Kato, who had led an expedition eastwards into
Ham-gyŭng Province, hearing of the evacuation of P’yŭng-yang,
immediately put his troops in motion and hastened down
to Seoul, burning and ravaging as he came. And in a short
time all the remnants of the Japanese army were congregated
in the capital.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Japanese retreat from P’yŭng-yang was not without
its casualties. A Korean general, Ko On-băk, met a body of
the Japanese, probably a part of the retreating army, at P’a-ju,
seventy <em>li</em> out of Seoul, and punished them severely, taking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>as it is said, seventy heads; not a great achievement when we
remember that the Japanese were practically unarmed.</p>

<p class='c000'>But by this time the Chinese Gen. Yi was on his way south
from P’yŭng-yang, rather tardily as the Koreans thought,
but hearing of this engagement of Gen. Ko, he quickened
his pace. Coming to He-on Pass, some seventy <em>li</em> out from
Seoul, his horse slipped, throwing him heavily on his face. He
was severely though not dangerously hurt. At that moment
a company of Japanese was sighted on the mountain side
and Gen. Yi ordered instant pursuit. The Japanese, probably
a foraging party from Seoul, closed with them and as the
Chinese were on a marshy piece of land, where they sank to
their knees in the mud, and had no other weapons with them
but their swords, the Japanese inflicted severe punishment on
them, killing eighty of their number. Gen. Yi was so weak
from loss of blood that he did not dare to prolong the fight.
So he called a retreat and the next day went into camp at
Tong-p’a, a hundred <em>li</em> from Seoul. From that point he immediately
despatched a letter to the Emperor saying: “There
are 20,000 Japanese firmly intrenched in Seoul and with my
present force I dare not attack them. I am also ill and cannot
fight. I would be glad if you would send someone to relieve
me of the command.” Then he retreated fifty <em>li</em> further,
to Song-do, in spite of the earnest entreaties of the Koreans.
The Korean General Yi Pin said, “You came to render aid to
our country. Why is it that you now retreat?” whereupon
one of the general’s staff promptly kicked him out of the house.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gen. Yi ordered Gen. Sa Tă-su to go and guard the ferry
at the Im-jin river which was now partly frozen but impassable
for boats and ordered the Koreans to go to work building
a bridge for the transport of the Chinese army. Here was a
piece of work that might have daunted a better engineer than
the average Korean general. But the way the Koreans went
about it and the brilliant success they achieved show what
the Korean was capable of when really in earnest. And it
shows as well how thoroughly they were determined to see
chastisement inflicted upon the Japanese. A swift broad
river partly frozen, no possibility of driving piles nor of erecting
any supports from the bed of the river itself. It must be
a suspension bridge or none at all. On either side of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>river heavy timbers were planted firmly in the ground some
twenty feet apart. Behind these horizontally were laid heavy
logs. Then between these supports on either bank were
stretched fifteen heavy strands of the tough fibrous vine called
<em>chik</em> by the Koreans. It is the <em>pueraria thunbergiana</em>. Of
course these sagged in mid-stream so that they swept the <ins class='correction' title='water,'>water.</ins>
To remedy this, stout levers were inserted between the strands
and twisted until the cables swung clear of the water by many
feet. The foundation having thus been laid, willow branches
were spread thickly upon the cables and finally a heavy layer
of earth was added and the whole was packed down tight by
the treading of many feet. And so was completed the first
suspension bridge which history records. We see that during
this war the Koreans had originated three important
things, namely the iron-clad, the mortar and bomb, and now
the suspension bridge. And on this bridge the whole Chinese
army crossed in safety.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Gen. Yi was tired of the war and was extremely
anxious to get back to China. So when he heard that <a id='corr9.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Nato'>Kato</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_9.19'>Kato</a></span>
was crossing the peninsula he said, “He may come to P’yŭng-yang
and in that case I must hasten back to that place and
hold it against him.” So he started back toward that city,
leaving Gen Wang P’il-jŭk in charge of the forces that were
advancing on Seoul.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this point mention must be made of the victories of
Gen. Chöng Mun-bu in Ham-gyŭng Province. In three successive
fights he had defeated a large, though not the main,
body of Japanese and seems to have entirely cut it off from
forming a junction with Gen. Kato as he retreated toward
Seoul with his dwindling though still formidable army.
After the departure of the Japanese, Gen. Chöng went to the
far north, even to the far Tu-man River and inflicted severe
punishment on all those who had aided the Japanese or
had sided with them in the betrayal of the two princes.
This done, he pacified the disturbed province as much
as he could and then disbanded the militia and sent them
to their homes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Kwŭn Ryŭl, the governor of Chŭl-la, of whom we have
heard before, took 4000 men and marched on Seoul, not by
the main road but by way of Yang-ch’ŭn. Crossing the Han
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>at that point he went into camp at Hăng-ju and surrounded
it with a paling of heavy logs. The Japanese in Seoul ridiculed
it but sent a strong body of troops to attack it. A long
fierce fight ensued and the result was doubtful. At last the
Japanese succeeded in setting fire to the wooden paling and
had it not been for the most strenuous efforts on the part
of the Koreans they would have been burned out. But they
succeeded in quenching the flames. When their arrows were
gone their outlook was again apparently hopeless, but in the
very nick of time Admiral Yi Pin of Chŭl-la Province came
up the river by boat with 20,000 arrows and as the camp was
immediately on the river bank the Koreans were saved, and
soon the Japanese were driven back. <a id='corr10.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Kyŭn'>Kwŭn</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_10.13'>Kwŭn</a></span> Ryŭl took the
bodies of the Japanese who had fallen, cut them in pieces and
impaled the fragments on the top of the stockade. The next
day the Chinese general Sa Tă-su arrived and, seeing these
trophies of victory, praised Gen. Kwŭn highly and sent him
to P’a-ju to guard against any possible northward movement
of the Japanese. At the same time small companies were
sent in all directions to cut off foraging expeditions of the
enemy. In this way the Japanese in Seoul were cut off from
all supply of fuel. The Japanese general who had suffered
defeat at Hăng-ju thirsted for revenge, and he led many a
fierce sally from Seoul, but always with great loss.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the third month confidence was so far restored in the
north that the king began to think of returning toward the
capital. The first stage of this journey was as far as Yong-yu.
At this same time the Japanese sent a letter to the Korean
general Yu Sŭng-nyong saying that they wished to conclude
a treaty of peace. Gen. Yu as in duty bound sent this
message on to the Chinese Gen. Yi in P’yŭng-yang. He in
turn despatched Sim Yu-gyŭng, who had before acted as an
emissary of peace between the Japanese and the Emperor, to
take charge of the negotiations and with instructions more
or less definite. When this commissioner arrived in the
vicinity of Seoul a meeting took place between him and the
two Japanese leaders, Konishi and Kato, in mid-stream off
the village of Yong-san. Gen Sim opened the conference
by saying, “If you had listened to my advice in P’yŭng-yang
you would have saved yourselves all this trouble. The Chinese,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>40,000 strong, are all about you. They have gone south to
fortify the Cho-ryŭng Pass and thus cut off your retreat.
The Han River is guarded so thoroughly that you cannot
cross; Gen. Yi Yŭ-song is returning from the north with
300,000 fresh troops (an unblushing lie) and I am prepared to
offer you the only possible way of escape. You must give up
the two princes; you must leave the capital and move south
to the coast of Kyŭng-sang Province. Then and not till then
will we conclude peace and the Emperor will recognize your
king as his vassal.” The vanquished invaders saw that
there was nothing to do but comply, and so in the name of
the thirty-seven Japanese generals they engaged to evacuate
Seoul on the nineteenth day of the fourth moon. It was
further agreed that they should leave untouched 20,000 bags
of rice which were stored in the government granaries. The
two princes were to accompany the Japanese as far as Fusan
and were to be handed over to the Korean authorities there.</p>

<p class='c000'>In accordance with their promise, the Japanese evacuated
the city on the very day appointed, and Gen. Yi Yŭ-song,
who seems to have recovered his health rapidly after he found
that the Japanese did not mean fight, entered the city the
following day. The condition in which he found things is
almost indescribable. The Ancestral Temple and three palaces
had been burned. Only the Nam-pyŭl-gung, which the invaders
had used as headquarters, was standing. The country
all about was lying fallow and a great famine stared the Koreans
in the face. A thousand bags of rice were hastily
brought and made up into soup or gruel, mixed with pine
leaves, and a few of the starving thousands were fed. As
Gen. Sa Tă-su was passing along the street he saw a young
child trying to suck milk from the breast of its dead mother.
The sight aroused his compassion and he carried the child to
his quarters and ordered it to be cared for. Rice was so
scarce that a whole piece of cotton cloth could be purchased
with about three quarts of it. A horse cost but three pecks
of rice. Famishing men fought and killed each other, the
victors eating the vanquished, sucking the marrow from the
bones and then dying themselves of surfeit. It is even said
that when a drunken Chinese soldier vomited, half starved
men would crawl to the place and fight over the possession of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>this horrible substitute for food. This state of things naturally
brought on an epidemic of the native fever, a species of
typhus, and the dead bodies of its victims lay all along the
road, the head of one being pillowed on the breast of another.
The dead bodies in and immediately around Seoul were
gathered and piled in a heap outside the Water Mouth Gate
and it is affirmed that the pile was ten feet higher than the
wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was on the twentieth of the fourth moon that Gen.
Yi entered Seoul. He took up his quarters in the Nam-pyŭl-gung.
He seemed to be in no haste to pursue the Japanese,
so Gen. Yu Sŭng-nyong hinted that as the Japanese were in
full flight it might be well to hurry after them and cut them
down as occasion offered. The Chinese general had no intention
of leaving his comfortable quarters that soon, but he
gave consent to the project of pursuit and detailed 10,000
men under the lead of Gen Yi Yŭ-băk. A day or so later
this doughty warrior returned saying that he had a pain in
the leg. So ended the first attempt at pursuit. Then the
Korean Gen. Kwŭn Ryŭl came in from P’a-ju and urged
that there be immediate pursuit, but for some unexplained
reason the Chinese commander forbade it, and the native
accounts even add that he sent secretly and had the boats on
the Han destroyed so as to render pursuit of the Japanese
impossible.</p>

<p class='c000'>After crossing the Han River, the retreating Japanese
seem to have been in very ill humor, for they did not confine
their exhibitions of temper to the living alone but even attacked
the dead. They dug open the royal tomb at Chung-neung
a short distance the other side of the river. Digging
fifteen measures deep they found some rags and a few bones.
These they scattered about on the ground. They then filled
in the hole with rubble. Another royal tomb was opened and
the casket and remains were burned.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the beginning of the fifth moon a letter arrived from
the Military Commissioner, Song Eung-ch’ang, in P’yŭng-yang,
ordering a general pursuit of the Japanese. The Koreans
believe this to have been a mere blind, for the Japanese
had twenty days the start of them and pursuit was of course
out of the question. At this point again the Koreans make a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>serious charge against the Chinese, asserting that the Japanese,
before leaving Seoul, sent large sums of money toward
P’yŭng-yang for Gen. Yi Yŭ-song and Song Eung-ch‘ang, and
that by this means they secured immunity from pursuit.
The delay was a cause of great wonderment to the Koreans
and it is not unlikely that this theory of a bribe explained for
them most fully the actions of the Chinese. And it must be
confessed that there is little in the temperament or antecedents
of the Chinese on which to base a refutation of the charge. An
instance is cited to bring home the charge. A Korean who
had come upon a Japanese straggler and killed him was severely
beaten by order of the Chinese general in charge.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally, when all too late, Gen. Yi made a pretense of
pursuit, but after crossing Cho-ryŭng Pass and still finding
himself no nearer the enemy than before, he turned back and
resumed his comfortable quarters in Seoul. If he thought the
Japanese would hasten to take boat and return to their native
land, he was much mistaken. It may be that they wished to
do so, but the terrible punishment that Admiral Yi Sun-sin
had inflicted upon the army of reinforcement made them wary
of approaching the coast, and so the Japanese forces in the
south found themselves practically entrapped. Had the Korean
land forces been led at this time by a man of the skill and
bravery of old admiral Yi the country would have been spared
long years of war.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Japanese in their flight south were brought face to
face with this stern fact, and like the soldiers that they were
they set themselves to solve the problem. They wanted to be
near the sea, perhaps with a view to taking advantage of any
opportunity that might present itself of slipping across to
Japan, and yet they were so numerous that, living as they must
on forage, it would be impossible for them all to encamp at the
same place. So they adopted the plan of fortifying a long strip
of the southern coast, reaching from the harbor of So-sang in
the district of Ul-san in Kyŭng-sang Province to Sun-ch‘ŭn in
Ch‘ŭl-la Province, a distance of over two hundred and seventy
miles. There were in all between twenty and thirty camps.
Being thus about ten miles apart they had room for forage and
still were near enough each other to render assistance in case
the Koreans or their allies the Chinese should besiege them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>at any point. These fortified camps were all of the same
general kind, overlooking the sea from a bluff and on the
land side surrounded by a moat and earthworks. These preparations
were made with the utmost care, for there was no
hope of immediate succor and the Japanese foresaw stirring
times.</p>

<p class='c000'>In course of time the Chinese court was informed of these
events and the success of their generals in the north seems to
have given them some enthusiasm for prosecuting the war; so
additional troops were sent to the front under the command
of Generals Yu Chung and Hŭ Kuk-ch‘ŭng. These troops
numbered 5,000 and were from southern China. Among
them there are said to have been many “ocean imps,” or savages
from the southern islands. These men could enter the
water, it is said, and scuttle the enemy’s ships from beneath.
We are told that there were also in this army some men of
immense stature who came in carts rather than on foot. These
forces went into camp at Sŭng-ju in Kyŭng-sang Province.
At this place there was also a large Korean army under Generals
Kim Ch‘ŭn-il, Kim Sang-gön, Ch‘oé Kyŭng-whé, Ko
Chong-hu, Yang San-do and Yi Chong-in. Under them were
large numbers of militia and raw recruits, and this accounts
in part for the speedy fall of the town and the terrible slaughter
that ensued. The Japanese laid siege to the place and
after nine days, during which time the Japanese made a hundred
separate assaults, the latter were reinforced and the defenders,
exhausted by the long struggle, were finally driven
from the wall and the Japanese effected an entrance. But
even after they got in, the Koreans fought desperately and
sold their lives as dearly as possible. Of this most sanguinary
battle only one incident is preserved in the Korean accounts.
When the Japanese entered the city and had advanced to a
point on the wall which overlooks the waters of the Nam-gang
(river), a desperate encounter took place, in the midst of
which the Korean general, Yi Chong-in, seized two of the
Japanese about the waist and, dragging them to the brink
of the precipice, threw himself and them into the water below.
Korean accounts say that in this battle the almost incredible
number of 70,000 Koreans were killed and that an equal number
of the Japanese perished. This latter must be an exaggeration,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>for the loss of that number must have swept well-nigh
the entire Japanese army from the country. We must remember
that the Japanese army had received practically no
reinforcements from the time it first landed on Korean soil,
and it is safe to say that what with the losses by sickness and
accident, together with the thousands who had fallen at the
hands of the Koreans and Chinese, the original force must
have dwindled to 150,000 or less; in which case the loss of
70,000 men must have put them <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>hors de combat</em></span> at once. This
battle is called the greatest in the whole war, by the Koreans,
though it is not considered the most important.</p>

<p class='c000'>An interesting story is told of a dancing-girl of this town.
When the Japanese took possession of the place she was appropriated
by one of the Japanese generals. One day while
they were feasting in a summer-house on the wall overlooking
the river, she began to weep. He asked her the reason and
she replied, “You have come here and driven away our people
and our king. I do not know whether my sovereign is living,
and yet I sit here and feast. I can hardly claim to be
better than the beasts, to sit here and make merry. I must
put an end to my life.” Thereupon she threw her arms
about her paramour and flung herself and him over the edge,
thus ending her weary life and helping to avenge her native
land at the same time. For this reason she was canonized at
a later date and her spirit was worshiped at this place each
year by royal edict.</p>

<p class='c000'>All this time the great Admiral Yi was in camp at Han-san
Island off the coast of Kyŭng-sang Province. His force was
not large, but during his enforced idleness he prepared for
future work. He set all his men to work making salt by
evaporating sea water, and by this means he got together a
great store of provisions. Needing barracks for the soldiers,
he offered to the carpenters and workmen about a bag of
salt for a day’s work. His energy and patriotism were so contagious
that many worked for nothing, and the barracks were
soon built. At this point the king conferred upon him the
admiralty of the three provinces of Ch’ung-ch’ŭng, Chŭl-la
and Kyŭng-sang.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the ninth moon the Commissioner Song Eung-ch’ang
and Gen Yi Yŭ-song collected their forces and started back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>for China. They evidently considered the back bone of the
invasion broken, and so it was; but like most spinal diseases
it was destined to linger on for years before it came to an end.
When these generals set out on their homeward way they left
10,000 Chinese soldiers in the hands of the Korean <a id='corr16.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='gererals'>generals</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_16.5'>generals</a></span> Yu
Chŭng and O Yu-ch’ang to act as a bodyguard for the king.
In spite of their suspicions of the corruptibility of Gen. Yi
Yŭ-song, the Koreans speak in high terms of him. They describe
him as a young man of thirty, of handsome person,
broad mind and possessed of great skill in the art of war.
When he was on the eve of returning to China he bared his
head and showed the Koreans that his hair was already turning
gray. He told them it was because he had worked so hard
for them, which piece of bathos seems to have impressed
them deeply.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was on the fourth day of the tenth moon of the year
1593 that the king reentered the gates of Seoul after his long
hard exile in the north. But he found the city almost a
desert. The palaces were burnt and the ancestral temple was
level with the ground. Under the circumstances he decided
to stop for some time in that part of the city which is called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Chong-dong, the present foreign quarter, near the West Gate.
Here there had been the grave of one of the wives of the
founder of the dynasty, but her body had long ago been disinterred
and removed to a place outside the Northeast Gate.
So the king took up his quarters at the Myŭng-ye-gung. It
is the exact spot where the King of Korea lives today. A
considerable tract of land about it was surrounded by a stake
fence with a gate at the east and at the west. This royal residence
was named the Si-ö-sa or “Temporary Residence.”
Here the king lived thirteen years while the palace now
known as “The Old Palace” was being built. The king was
desirous of rebuilding on the spot where his palace had stood
before, the Kyöng-bok-kung, but he was told by the geomancers
that that would be an unpropitious site. In order to
build the new palace a tax of half a piece of cotton cloth was
levied upon each man throughout the country. In some cases
rice was accepted as a substitute.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the king had entered the city, one of his first acts
was to go to the site of the ancient Confucian Temple and,
standing on the melancholy spot, utter the following lament:
“The spirit of Confucius permeates space as water permeates
the soil beneath our feet. If my faithfulness is great enough,
let the spirit of Confucius rest down upon this spot.” He
noticed that none of the people were in mourning and so ordered
that all those who had lost parents in the war should
assume the mourner’s garb.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this time a strong faction arose whose wish was to see
the king lay aside his royal prerogative in favor of his son.
This prince was a son by a concubine, for the queen had no
children. He was an ambitious but profligate fellow and had in
his heart no loyalty for his father. Some of the courtiers went
so far as to memorialize the King to the effect that it might
add to the contentment of the people if the king should put
the reins of government into the hands of his son. He hesitated
to do this, for he knew the young man and how unfit he
was to rule. At the suggestion of Song Eung-ch‘ang, the
emperor sent to the king appointing the Crown Prince to the
governorship of the southern provinces in conjunction with
the Chinese general, Yu Chung. The prince was delighted at
this and hastened to his post at Chŭn-ju. He practically took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>the whole jurisdiction of the south out of the hands of the
king and even held the competitive examinations for literary
degrees, which was an exclusively royal prerogative.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another of the Chinese generals accused the king before
the emperor of effeminacy and love of luxury and suggested
that one of the best of the Korean generals be elevated
to the throne in his place, but Gen. Suk Sŭng, who was very
loyal to Korea, induced the emperor merely to send a letter
upbraiding the king for his love of luxury and claiming that
this was the cause of Japanese successes in the peninsula.
The letter ended with an exhortation to arouse himself, work
up a competent army, and complete the work of driving out
the Japanese. The envoy bearing this missive was met at
P‘a-ju by Gen. Yu Sŭng-nyong and an escort. The Chinaman
told him that his arrival in Seoul would be the signal for
some very important disclosures. General Yu and Gen.
Chŭk conferred together about this matter and decided that
the king must in any event be prevented from abdicating, for
their official heads depended upon his retention of the reins
of power. They also persuaded the envoy to their view, so
that when the king read the letter and declared his intention
to abdicate, the envoy objected that this could not be done
until he had sent a letter to the emperor and obtained his
consent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile there was going on in the south a sort of geurilla
warfare against the Japanese. It was led principally by
Kim Tŭk-nyŭng, a self-made man who had the confidence of
the prince. This man had put his whole fortune into the
cause and had himself fitted out 5,000 men. His method was
to pass from place to place with great rapidity and strike the
enemy when they were least expecting attack. In this way
he earned from the Japanese the name “The Flying General.”
He is said to have been uniformly successful.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of another ilk were Song U-jin, Yi Neung-su and Hyŭn
Mong. These gathered about them bands of desperate men
and went about the country looting and burning. In Seoul
there was consternation. At any moment one of these bands
might enter the city and work their will. The Crown Prince,
a cause of great uneasiness, was still at Chŭn-ju and for aught
anyone knew he might be plotting the overthrow of the government.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>In fact this impression was so strong that the highwaymen
dared to write to him complaining of the king and
asserting that they were going to make a clean sweep. The
implication was plain, that they intended to put the prince
upon the throne. The solicitude of the people in Seoul took
form in the rumor that Yi Tă-hyŭng himself, the Minister of
War, was in league with the rebels. For forty successive
days this injured minister went and knelt at the palace gate
and begged that the king would have him executed, as he
could not endure the charge of unfaithfulness.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was customary for the emperor to nominate an heir
apparent for the Korean throne, but at the beginning of this
war it had seemed necessary to appoint one immediately and
so the king had informally promised the prince that he should
be king. The latter now demanded that this be confirmed
by the emperor and a messenger was sent to the Chinese
court for that purpose; but as the emperor had no son himself
except by a concubine and was loath to put him on the throne
of China, so he was unwilling to see this prince put on the
throne of Korea. The result was that he sent back a prompt
refusal, which for the time dashed the hopes of the ambitious
prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>It appears that the rebuke which the emperor administered
to the king was in some senses deserved. The king after
all his wearisome exile in the north, probably paid more attention
to the pleasures of peace <a id='corr19.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='that'>than</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_19.26'>than</a></span> was for his own good or
the good of the country. If so the rebuke had its effect, for
the king immediately roused himself and set to work reorganizing
the finances of the country and putting the army on a
better working basis. Hitherto the revenue had all been collected
in rice but now he allowed the revenue to be collected
in any kind of produce, and the collection of it was farmed
out to various individuals, a practice which at the time may
have had its good points but which at the same time had
within itself very bad possibilities. The reorganization of
the army was a matter of great importance and the king set
himself to it with a will. Heretofore each general had had
his own following and there was no central power nor seat of
authority. Each body of troops followed the caprice of its
leader with no reference to any general plan. Before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Chinese general Yi Yŭ-song left he put into the hands of the
king a book treating of the art of war, a work written by
Ch’ŭk Kye-gwang. This book the king put into use and appointed
Cho Kyŭng and Yu Sŭng-nyong to have charge of
the whole matter of military reorganization. In order to put
the new plan into operation a large number of poor and destitute
soldiers were gathered. They had to pass a physical
test which consisted in lifting a rice bag full of earth, and of
leaping over a wall as high as their heads. In ten days two
thousand men were found who endured the test. The drill
consisted of three parts, (1) firing with guns, (2) shooting
with bow and arrow, (3) using the battle axe. In time these
men became the royal guard and escort. The number gradually
increased to 10,000, 2,000 being attached to each of the
government departments. The whole force was divided into
two parts and while one part was drilling in the city the
other was set to work farming in the suburbs. In this way
they raised the food necessary for the sustenance of the whole
force. The plan was extended to the country, and teachers
were sent to practice the country soldiers. It became a
species of militia. From this time the quality and discipline
of the Korean army improved in a marked degree.</p>

<p><em>THE LAUNDRY.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>It appears that the Koreans were not the only ones who
suspected Gen. Yi Yŭ-song of showing favors to the Japanese,
for the emperor took notice of it and deprived him of his
high rank. He was supplanted by Gen. Ko Yang-gyŭm.
This new appointee advanced toward the border of Korea as
far as Liao-tung and from that point sent a letter to the king
saying that the Chinese had already lost enough men and
treasure in the war and that the king had better hasten to make
friends with the Japanese and induce them to come and do
obeisance to the emperor. It appears plain that this man
wanted peace to be patched up before he should be called
upon to do active work in the field. When the king saw this
letter he said, “When the Crown Prince becomes king he
can do as he pleases but as for me I will never make peace or
friendship with the Japanese.” But Yu Sŭng-nyong urged
the helplessness of Korea alone and the need of securing
China’s help at all hazards. Sŭng Hon urged the fact that
the new Chinese general had a large force in hand and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>must be conciliated at any cost. So the king reluctantly sent
an envoy to China asking that overtures of peace be made
with the Japanese. Even while this envoy was on the way,
the emperor, apparently thinking the war at an end, sent
an order commanding the immediate return of Gen. Yu Chung,
with all his forces, from the province of Kyŭng-sang. The
Crown Prince sent begging him not to go. The people all
about the country were in distress about it. He was believed
to be the only hope against the Japanese. The command of
the emperor however was law and the general was forced to
obey. Taking his army, together with the wives and children
of those who had been married to Korean women, he
went back to Liao-tung. It is said that <a id='corr21.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='ever'>over</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_21.13'>over</a></span> 10,000 of the
Chinese took back their Korean wives to China, but six years
later they all returned to their native land.</p>

<p class='c000'>Kato was desirous of meeting and having a talk with the
Korean general Kim Eung-sŭ, the general of Kyŭng-sang
Province. To this end he sent a Japanese named Yo-si-ra to
arrange a meeting, and in course of time they met at the town
of Ham-an and had a conference. Kato opened the conference
as follows: “If Korea will help us to become the vassals
of China we will remove all our troops from Korea immediately
and we will also consider it a great favor.” But Gen. Kim,
who knew of the enmity which existed between Kato and
Konishi, <a id='corr21.25'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>waved</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_21.25'>waved</a></span> the main question by asking, “Why is it that
you and Konishi cannot agree? It is plain that so long as he
is here such a plan as you recommend cannot be carried out.”
Kato answered, “I have long wished to make an end of him,
but can never get a chance. If in some way we could work
up a charge against him and circulate it among the troops we
might be able to get all the army removed to Japan.” As to
the further deliberations of these two men we are not informed,
but we judge from this passing glimpse that Konishi the
younger man was so firmly intrenched in the affection of his
troops that Kato despaired of making head against him until
that affection was in some way alienated. In this Kato acknowledges
his virtual defeat at the hands of his youthful
rival.</p>

<p class='c000'>The emperor was not as anxious as his generals to make
peace with the Japanese, and when he heard that his new appointee
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>to the peninsula was in favor of a treaty with the invaders
he promptly ordered his retirement, and Gen. Son
Kwang was sent to take his place. Hardly had this happened
when the envoy Ho Ok, from the Korean court, arrived,
asking that a treaty be made with the Japanese. When his
message was delivered all the court was in favor of the plan;
but the Prime Minister said that as they had been deceived
once by the Japanese general So Sŭ-bi, who had accompanied
Gen. Sim Yu gyăng from Pyŭng-yang on a similar errand
before, it would be well to test them with three propositions.
“(1) We will give the king of Japan the royal investiture. (2)
Every Japanese soldier must leave Korea. (3) The Japanese
must promise never to disturb Korea again.” This plan pleased
the emperor and Gen. So Sŭ-bi was sent for, that he
might appear before the emperor and accept these conditions.
On arriving at Peking the Japanese readily acceded to the
terms and exclaimed, “We will gladly agree to this and will
swear by heaven to abide by the terms.” Thereupon Sim Yu-gyăng,
who had always had a strange leaning toward the Japanese,
now exclaimed, “Japan now evidently desires to become
China’s vassal. An envoy must be sent to invest Hideyoshi
with the royal insignia, and all this trouble will end.”
But Hŭ Hong-gang had a truer estimate of the visitor and
remarked, “The Japanese are a subtle people, and all this
talk of becoming vassals of China is mere pretense. There
is no use in sending an envoy to Japan.” Gen. Sŭk Sŭng
said, “This man seems to be honest in what he says. Gen.
Sim Yu-gyŭng should accompany So Sŭ-bi back to Korea and
there confer with the Japanese leaders and then arrangements
can be made for investing the king of Japan.” The emperor
so ordered and at the same time appointed Yi Chong-sŭng as
envoy extraordinary to Japan to perform the ceremony of investiture.
Yang Pang-hyŭng was appointed his second.
These events all occurred in the latter part of the year 1593.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the new year opened the political sky was dark enough.
Not only were the Japanese intrenched in the south but predatory
bands infested the country and the government troops
had all they could do to hold them in check, let alone any
offensive operations against the Japanese. However, after a
hard chase a large band of the miscreants were brought to bay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>at Hoe-mun Mountain and cut to pieces. At this time also
the king sent again to Nanking asking that his successor be
nominated, but again he was refused.</p>

<p class='c000'>The career of Gen. Kim Tŭk-nyŭng whom, as we have
seen, the Japanese had dubbed “The Flying General,” affords
us another example of the fatal weakness of Korea, in the
envy excited against any really successful man; for even while
Gen. Kim was successfully combatting the Japanese in his own
way, his very successes aroused the spleen of Gen. Yun Keun-su
who accused him to the king of having killed plenty of
Koreans, but never a Japanese. On the strength of this
groundless charge, and without questioning its truth, the king
brought Gen. Kim to Seoul and imprisoned him a year. And
so a man of highest loyalty, of such unselfish patriotism as to
devote the whole of his private fortune to the fitting out of
soldiers to fight his country’s foes, was dragged away from a
successful field of work to languish in prison, simply because
a less successful man begrudged him his fame.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now began an amusing comedy between the Chinese,
who took the Japanese seriously, and the latter who were
merely playing off the Chinese in order to save time.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the fourth moon of 1395 the embassy from China to
Japan arrived in Seoul, and immediately Gen. Sim Yu-gyŭng
posted southward to see Kato and tell him that the Chinese
embassy had already come and that he must hasten to get all
the Japanese troops out of the country before the embassy
should arrive at Fusan. To all this the wily Kato answered
gravely, “You had better stay here a few weeks while I take
a run over to Japan and ask Hideyoshi about it, and if he
gives the order to take the troops back, it can be done immediately.”
When he came back, instead of answering the main
question he said that it would be well for a Korean to accompany
the envoy to Japan. Meanwhile the Chinese envoy Yi
Chong-sŭng, in Seoul, sent messenger after messenger urging
the speedy removal of the Japanese troops from the peninsula;
but Kato kept putting it off on one ground or another, and
made no move to go. When, however, this part of the comedy
had proceeded to such a point that the Japanese began to fear
the Chinese would see that it was indeed a comedy, Kato took
a few regiments of men from Ung-ch’ŭn and Kŭ-je and made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>preparations as if to depart, meanwhile sending Gen. Sim to
Seoul to say that he was waiting for the envoy and his suite
to come south and accompany the departing army to Japan.
Five months had already elapsed since the envoy had arrived
in Seoul, and he therefore determined to accept this invitation.
Moving southward, he came to Nam-wŭn in Chŭl-la
Province where he stopped, fearing to go directly into the
Japanese camp. While there he gained the soubriquet of
“frog-eater,” for he was so fond of the flesh of that reptile
that he compelled the people to hunt for and procure it
for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gen. Son Kwang, from his comfortable quarters in Liao-tung,
sent him a letter charging him with cowardice and
ordering him to proceed at once on his way. Under this
stimulus he proceeded to Fusan; but Kato would not come
to see him, saying, “I must receive instructions from Japan
before I can take you across the straits, so I will cross
once more and find out the will of my royal master in regard
to the matter.” After an absence of two months he came
back and opened another act of the comedy by asserting that
he must first take Gen. Sim across to Japan and arrange the
ceremony of investiture, and that the envoy proper might follow
when all was ready. By this time, what with the fear of
the Japanese and bewilderment at the intricacy of Japanese
diplomacy the poor envoy was well-nigh distraught. When
therefore, with the beginning of the new year 1596 a Chinaman
named So Hak-myŭng came from Japan and informed
him that Hideyoshi had not the remotest idea of becoming a
vassal of China and that if the Chinese envoy should cross to
Japan he would never come back again, it capped the climax,
and that very night the wretched envoy, taking only one servant
and a few clothes tied up in a cloth, made his escape
from the Japanese camp and fled away northward. He
traveled by night and hid by day, until at last he arrived
at Seoul. And so the curtain drops on another act of the
comedy.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Japanese found out that the envoy had made
his escape they were in a quandary, fearing lest they might
be punished for letting him go and so spoiling the fun. They
therefore gave chase, but not being able to overtake the light-footed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>envoy, they contented themselves with surrounding
the house of the vice-envoy Yang Pang-hyŭng. The latter
knew of his chief’s flight, but to draw away suspicion from
himself he pretended to sleep late that morning and claimed
to know nothing about the matter. When at last he was told
of it by the Japanese general Kuroda, he said quietly, “Well,
he was a young man and a little nervous. He should have
gone to Japan long ago instead of waiting around here. It
will be of no use for you to chase him.” He then deliberately
arose, went to the room lately occupied by his chief,
took possession of the Emperor’s letter and returned to his
own apartments. By his coolness and presence of mind he
allayed the excitement of the Japanese and perhaps saved his
own life.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Japanese soldiers who had been detailed to return
to Japan were of course delighted to go back to their homes
and were eager to set sail from Fusan. They had their baggage
all on board and were hoping to start at any moment.
But when they heard of the flight of the Chinese envoy they
knew there would be a long delay and they were sorely disappointed;
so much so in fact that many of them wept aloud.
It is probable that every Japanese soldier in the peninsula
would have been glad of an opportunity to return to Japan.
Only the severe discipline of the Japanese army and the lack
of boats prevented them from deserting in large numbers; at
least we may gather as much from the frequent references to
the home-sickness of the Japanese soldiers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yang Pang-hyŭng called the weeping soldiers before him
and said, “We have waited here so long that my chief got
tired and went back. But I remain and the imperial missive
is with me. He has fled only to Nam-wŭn and if you send
there you will doubtless find him.” This led them to believe
that their fond hope of returning home would soon be gratified.</p>

<p class='c000'>All this time the young Konishi, the rival of Kato, sat
disdainfully silent watching the empty game which his unpopular
rival was playing with the Chinese. When he heard
of the flight of the envoy he laughed and said, “I knew he
was no genuine envoy from the Emperor, for if he had been he
would not have dared to show his heels like this.” This remark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>was intended to imply that while Kato had been trying
to hoodwink the Chinese, they, on the other hand, had
hoodwinked him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yang Pang-hyŭng lost no time in informing the Emperor
of the perfidy of his chief, and the Emperor immediately
ordered the recalcitrant official to be caught and imprisoned.
He raised Yang Pang-hyŭng to the position of Chief of the
Embassy and appointed Sim Yu-gyŭng as his second. We
will remember that Sim Yu-gyŭng had already gone to Japan
with Kato, bearing the imperial gifts, which consisted of a
royal robe with the embroidered design of a dragon, a jade
belt, royal head-gear, a map of China, a book on war and
various other kinds of treasures. He there married the
daughter of a Japanese named Arima, and is said by the
Koreans to have become a thorough Japanese. This may have
been part of the game he was playing, and we may see the
fruits of it later.</p>

<p class='c000'>Kato was determined that a Korean envoy should accompany
the Chinese one to Japan and to this end he told one
of the Korean officials, “If a Korean envoy does not accompany
the Chinese embassy to Japan the peace will be only between
Japan and China, and Korea will have no part in it.
This will lead to grave troubles.” Gen. Sim also sent his nephew
back from Japan to ask that a Korean envoy accompany
the Chinese embassy. So the king appointed two men, Whang
Sin and Pak Hong-jang to this work, conferring upon them
the title of T’ong-sin-sa or “Faithful Messenger.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the fifth moon of this year 1596 Gen. Konishi massed
his troops in forty-six regiments on the southern coast and,
leaving only four regiments to guard Fusan, set sail for Japan.
With him went all the envoys, both Chinese and Korean.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now that lasting peace seemed to be assured, the king no
longer hesitated to hand over the reins of power to the Crown
Prince. He accordingly sent the royal insignia south to him,
and so doffed the responsibilities as well as the prerogatives
of royalty. But, strange to say, the prince strenuously refused
to accept them, insisting that he had no desire to take
the scepter from his father’s hand. Seven times he sent to
his father protesting his unwillingness to have the honor
thrust upon him. But the king would not listen. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>only after the courtiers had assembled before the palace for
twenty days in succession and besought him to retain the
scepter that they finally prevailed and he consented to continue
in the exercise of the royal prerogative.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yi Mong-hak, an unprincipled ruffian, ignorant but ambitious,
had joined the forces of Gen. Han Hyŭn and had
fought during the war. Now he started out on an independent
line. Gathering a force of over ten thousand men he attacked
and took Hong-san in Ch‘ung-ch‘ŭng Province, and
he followed it up by taking Im-ch‘ŭn, Ch‘ung-yang, Chöng-san
and Hong-ju. Yi Mong-hak had been deceiving his followers
by saying that Gen. Kim Tŭk-nyang was interested in
this scheme. But now they found that this same Gen. Kim
was arrayed against them and they saw they had been duped.
That night every man deserted the adventurer and the next
day he fell into the hands of the loyal troops and his head
was forwarded to Seoul. This shows the extremely unsettled
state of the country, and how any unprincipled man with
money and effrontery could offer serious opposition to the
government.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here again we find a striking example of that petty jealousy
which deprived Korea of most of her capable men. This
Gen. Kim Tŭk-nyŭng was a celebrated man. He was known
throughout the Korean army for his strength and prowess.
It is said of him that single-handed he would attack a tiger
and pin it to the ground with a spear. They also say that he
rode into battle with an iron mace of a hundred pounds weight
in each hand and he gave the Japanese so many hard knocks
that they gave him the name, “The General from under the
Rock.” The ministers at Seoul were suspicious of his rising
fame and went their ways to have him dragged down. They
charged him with having been in league with Yi Mong-hak
and won the king over. He was arrested and brought to
Seoul, where after a most disgraceful trial he was put to death.
The Japanese had such a high opinion of this man’s parts that
Konishi sent and had a portrait made of him. When he saw
the picture he exclaimed, “This man is indeed a General.”
When his death was announced, the Japanese held a great
feast in honor of the event. This was just on the eve of their
departure for home.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>As we have seen, it was in the summer of 1596 that the
Chinese and Korean envoys crossed to Japan with the returning
army of invasion. When they were brought into the
presence of Hideyoshi he treated them with scant courtesy.
When asked why he did not bow before the imperial missive
he replied that he had a sore leg and could not. He treated
the Korean envoy much worse than the Chinese, and said to
him, “I sent back the two princes as I agreed, but your king
never so much as thanked me. He has now sent as envoy a
man of inferior rank on purpose to insult me. I believe the
original Chinese envoy ran away at the instigation of your
king. I will treat the Chinese envoy civilly, but as for you I
shall send another army and be avenged on you.” After this
there was but one thing to do. Both the envoys packed up
their effects and started back home. When the Chinese
envoy arrived at Nanking bringing insult instead of submission
from Japan the Emperor was in a terrible rage and charged
Sim Yu-gyŭng with having betrayed his country. The
chief envoy was executed and the official who had advised
the sending of an embassy was thrown into prison and starved
to death, but Sim Yu-gyŭng in some way escaped with his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have now reached the halfway point between the two
invasions, or rather between the two parts of the double invasion.
Hideyoshi was still furious over the failure of his great
plan of invading China, and he must needs find some way to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>vent his spleen. He determined upon a second invasion of
Korea, not this time with a view to the invasion of China
but with the more modest desire to punish Korea, though
what Korea had done to deserve punishment it would be hard
to say. To be sure she had proved an obstacle to his vaulting
ambition, for had Hideyoshi’s original army sailed straight
for China instead of landing at Fusan, it probably would have
overthrown the Chinese capital. We must notice the changed
conditions which existed between the two countries. Korea
had now experienced the worst possible at the hands of the
Japanese and knew what to expect. Their soldiers had felt
the prick of Japanese swords and had in turn tasted the delights
of victory. That terrible glamor which surrounded the
dreaded islanders upon their first appearance had worn off and
some sort of equality had been effected between them. The
Koreans had meanwhile become possessed of firearms and
were measurably skilled in their use. They had learned never
to trust themselves to open battle when geurilla warfare was
feasible. They had demonstrated their great superiority on
the sea in the person of the Admiral Yi. When therefore we
remember that the Japanese had to leave their base of supplies
and live on what they could forage in the peninsula, it appears
that in spite of their prowess they had not much advantage
over the Koreans. But before making this second descent
upon the shores of Korea it was necessary for the Japanese
to get the redoubtable Admiral Yi Sun-sin out of the way.
No fleet from Japan would risk an encounter with him in his
“Tortoise Boat.” The Japanese had seen how the mutual
jealousies of the Koreans worked in their favor and they determined
to use this in getting Admiral Yi removed. So one
day a Japanese named Yo-si-ra made his appearance at the
camp of Gen. Kim Eung-sŭ, saying that he was tired of
being a Japanese and that he wanted to become a Korean.
He dressed in Korean clothes and kept going back and forth
between the Japanese and Koreans, giving the latter what
seemed to be much valuable information. He seemed to be
devoted to the Korean interests. One day he came in a state
of great excitement and said that the Japanese General Kato
was coming to Korea with a great fleet and that, as he was to
pass a certain island off the coast, Admiral Yi ought to be sent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>to lie in wait there and drive the invading fleet back or to
sink it. So Gen. Kim wrote to the king about it and asked
for orders. The king, trusting in the prowess of Admiral Yi,
gave his consent; but when that officer received these orders
he promptly replied that it was a trick to entrap him and thus
clear a way for a descent upon the mainland of Korea. He
therefore declined to run the risk, especially as the place mentioned
was studded with sunken rocks and was specially dangerous
for navigation. But the Japanese Yo-si-ra kept urging
Gen. Kim to see to it that the plan was carried out and at
last the General wrote to the king saying that Admiral Yi
declined to go. As may be supposed Admiral Yi had enemies
at court who could not let such an opportunity pass of getting
him into trouble. Consequently the iniquitous decree went
forth that Admiral Yi be seized and brought to Seoul and that
Wŭn Kyun be put in his place. The king intended to put
Admiral Yi to death, but one of the officials urged his former
services in palliation of his present offense and so the punishment
was commuted to loss of position alone. So it was
that Admiral Yi, the best soldier that Korea contained and to
whom the king owed his crown twice over, was degraded to
the ranks and became a common soldier. But most remarkable
of all, he made no complaint, but went quietly about his work
as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the first moon of the year 1597 the Japanese fleet set
sail from Japan. This army was led by Kato and Konishi although
the nominal commander in chief was a lad of seventeen
named Hideyaki. It is said that it took a thousand boats
to bring the army across the straits. Had Admiral Yi Sun-sin
been at his old post this fleet would never have touched
keel on the Korean coast but as it was there was no difficulty,
and the entire army landed safely at So-sang Harbor and immediately
threw up fortifications and went into camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first thought of the Koreans was to fortify Cho-ryŭng
Pass the one break in the mountain chain which the
Japanese must pass if they wished to march on Seoul. Gen.
Kwŭn Ryŭl with 23,000 men and other generals with troops
hastily gathered from various districts hastened to that important
pass and put the fortifications in good order, and the
king forthwith sent Kwŭn Hyŭp as envoy to Nanking to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>implore the intervention of China. And now we see the evil
results of Hideyoshi’s ill-treatment of the Chinese and Korean
envoys in Japan; for instead of making the Koreans send
time and again asking for help the Emperor was eager to
send troops into the peninsula to avenge himself upon the
Japanese. The Chinese army was put in charge of three
men: Gen. Yang Ho with rank of Military Commissioner,
Gen. Hyöng Kă as general-in chief and Admiral <a id='corr31.7'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>Ma Gwi</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_31.7'>Ma Gwi</a></span> as
commander of all the naval forces. Under these were Generals
Yang Wŭn, O Yu-ch’ung, U Păk-yŏng, Chin U-ch’ung,
So Eung-gung, Chin Hyo and Tong Han-yu. Gen. Yang
Ho came no further than P’yŭng-yang, his duties not requiring
his presence on the field of battle. Admiral Ma Kwi
and all the others came on to Seoul. From that point they
branched out in several directions, one going to Nam-wŭn in
Chŭl-la province, another to Song-ju in Kyŭng-sang Province,
another to Chŭn-ju, Chŭl-la Province, and another to
Ch’ung-ju in Ch’ung-ch’ŭng Province.</p>

<p class='c000'>Admiral Wŭn Kyun, who had supplanted Yi Sun-sin,
went to Han-san where Admiral Yi had worked so diligently
to build barracks with the proceeds of salt manufacture.
His first work was to overthrow all the rules and regulations
which his predecessor had so wisely promulgated. He then
drove away all who had been at all intimate with the former
admiral, who was now a common soldier under Kwŭn Ryul.
He then built a paling about the council-hall that Yi Sun-sin
had built and there he housed his harem and spent his time
in revelry and feasting. He would frequently have innocent
men called up and severely punished for mere amusement.
And thus he soon alienated the good will of all the troops
stationed there.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Kato, the astute Japanese general, through his tool
Yo-si-ra, kept at Gen. <a id='corr31.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='iKm'>Kim</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_31.31'>Kim</a></span>, urging him to have a fleet sent to
intercept a fleet of Japanese boats. He named a day on
which the Korean fleet would be sure to intercept a fleet of
the enemy. At last the order was given for Admiral Wŭn
Kyun to carry out this manoeuvre and though he had no
stomach for the enterprise he could not well demur, for this
was the very thing that had cost Admiral Yi his position.
So he got his boats together and sailed out to Chŭl-yŭng
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Island off Fusan. But a strong breeze sprang up and the sea
was rather rough and in the darkness of night the Korean fleet
became scattered. The next day the larger part of them rendezvoused
at Ka-dok Island where they unexpectedly met the
Japanese fleet and were vigorously attacked. Almost immediately
all Admiral Wŭn’s forces deserted him and his
only recourse was flight. Beaching his boat on Ch‘il-ch‘ŭn
Island he landed and drew about him what remnants of his force
he could find. When Gen. Kwŭn Ryul heard of this he sent a
stern order demanding that the admiral come out and fight.
That <a id='corr32.10a'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>valliant</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_32.10a'>valliant</a></span> man first filled <a id='corr32.10b'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='hemself'>himself</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_32.10b'>himself</a></span> with wine then sallied
forth only to be deserted again by his men. So the doughty
admiral again ran his boat aground and took to his heels. He
was so fat however that he could not run far, so he sat down
under a tree to get his breath. There the Japanese overtook
him and carried away his head in triumph. The second in command,
Yi Yŭ-geui, fled by boat after burning all the barracks
and provisions that were stored at Han-san.</p>

<p class='c000'>When these events became known the whole country
was in consternation. Yi Hang-bok, the king’s trusted
councillor, said, “Yi Sun-sin must be reinstated in his former
position.” It was a case of dire necessity and so the king
sent and conferred upon that faithful man his former office.
The trusty Yi set out on foot and rested not day nor night
until he reached his former position, Han-san. On all sides
he met the scattered and flying remnants of his former force.
He rallied them about him, promising that the Japanese should
still be held in check.</p>

<p class='c000'>But before Admiral Yi arrived on the scene of action a
tremendous force of Japanese both military and naval had
landed on the southern coast. Their objective point was
Nam-wŭn, where the Chinese general Yang Wŭn had pitched
his camp. Upon the approach of the Japanese the latter
burned all the houses outside the wall to prevent their
offering cover to an attacking force; but the Japanese soon
built a rough fence or palisade about the town, from behind
which they picked off the Chinese soldiers on the wall, at
leisure. The Chinese attempted to make a sortie but in their
eagerness to get out of the gate they became jammed in it and
were mown down by the long swords of the besiegers. Unfortunately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>for the Chinese and Koreans the following night was
full moon and the Japanese cut down every man that attempted
to escape. To the line of stakes which they had
planted about the town the Japanese fastened swords, and
when the people from the town tried to make good their
escape they found themselves impaled upon these weapons.
The Chinese commander, Yang Wŭn, rode at this barrier and
his horse was so impaled, but he succeeded in getting over
and making good his escape. The Japanese attacked the wall
in its weakest point and forced an entrance. The massacre
within the town beggars description. The Korean generals
Chöng Keui-wŭn, Yi Pong-nam, O Eung-jung, Kim Kyöng-no,
Sin Ho, Im Hyŭn, Yi Tŭk-whe and Yi Wŭn-ch‘un were
all killed, which indicates how sanguinary must have been
the fight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Immediately all northern Chŭl-la was in confusion and
the troops everywhere began to fall back toward the north.
In Seoul itself there was consternation. The king called his
officials about him and asked what should be done. They all
urged that the king stay in the capital. The queen and the
crown prince however were sent to Su-an in Ham-gyŭng
Province and the king prepared to move whenever it should
seem necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>But by this time Admiral Yi was again on the stage of
action and as alert as ever. He had as yet only ten boats
under him, but he had no lack of men, for the people all along
the coast, when they heard of his reinstatement, flocked to
him. He drew up his little fleet of ten boats in the shadow
of a mountain on Chin-do (island) and sent out reconnoitering
boats which returned just at night saying that the Japanese
were approaching. As the moon dropped behind the
mountain it left the Korean fleet in complete darkness and
soon the Japanese boats came sailing along in single file.
Admiral Yi deployed his boats in a long line and suddenly
they all raised a loud shout and fired point blank at the unsuspecting
Japanese. The latter thought they had run into a
powerful fleet and soon scattered in all directions. The next
day there was more serious work, however, for a fleet of
several hundred boats appeared. The Koreans were in some
trepidation, but the fearless admiral made straight for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>enemy and though soon surrounded he succeeded in sinking
thirty of the enemy’s boats. The rest evidently recognized
the master hand of Admiral Yi and turned and fled. He
gave chase, and before the battle ended the Japanese commander
Ma-da-si was killed. Returning from this remarkable
fight Admiral Yi proceeded to Han-san and set to work rebuilding
the barracks and making salt. It is said that in two
months time he stored away 20,000 bags of rice. His former
captains and soldiers came back to him in “clouds.” He also
found another source of revenue. The wealthy men all
through the south desired to get away from the disturbed
districts and so loaded their effects upon boats and sailed
away. Admiral Yi however stood in the way and made them
pay a toll of from one to three bags of rice for each boat.
From this source alone he collected above a thousand bags
of rice. He used this revenue in the purchase of copper for the
casting of cannon, and for the building of boats. Thousands
of people who feared to live on the mainland came and built
huts about his camp, until the island actually became too
small to hold more.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the fall of Nam-wŭn the Japanese, flushed with
victory, started northward toward Seoul, thinking without
doubt that they would have as easy a victory as before. Yang
Ho, hearing of the defeat of the Chinese, came post haste
from P’yŭng-yang and severely upbraided the generals and
charged them with lack of bravery. Without an hour’s
delay it was arranged that Generals Ha Sang, U Pak-yung,
Yang Teung and P‘a Sa should take a strong body of troops
and move southward to <a id='corr34.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Ch‘ung-chŭng'>Ch‘ung-ch‘ŭng</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_34.29'>Ch‘ung-ch‘ŭng</a></span> Province and intercept
the Japanese. This was done and the army ambushed at
Keum-o-p‘yŭng in the district of Chik-san. Soon the Japanese
came streaming along, neglecting all precautions, for they
had no idea of meeting an enemy. When therefore the
ambuscade opened fire on them it took but a few moments to
throw them into utter confusion. In the rout which ensued
an enormous number of the Japanese were killed. On the
following day the Japanese, who had mended their broken
ranks as best they could, came on to the attack, but their
losses had been so great that in spite of wonders of bravery
which they showed they were again crushed. The remnant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>of their force fled southward to Mok-ch‘un and Ch‘ung-ju.
This was one of the three great battles of the war and in importance
it was exceeded by none; for, though the forces
engaged were not so numerous nor the number of slain so
great, it broke once for all the self-confidence of the Japanese,
and they never again had the hardihood to attempt the approach
to Seoul. By this battle the war was definitely confined
to the southern provinces. The Commissioner Yang Ho suggested
to the king that he go out and survey the battle field,
and so the royal cavalcade rode out the South Gate. One of
the Chinese generals suspected that the king was something
of a coward and so, to test him, he gave the horse the king
was riding a sharp cut with a whip. The horse leaped into
the air with terror but the king held his seat and showed no
sign of fear. The Chinese were pleased at this and their respect
for the king was visibly increased.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seoul gave itself up to universal holiday in honor of the
victory, for it was still fresh in the minds of many how Seoul
had fared before at the hands of the invaders.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the tenth moon Gen. Konishi built a strong fort on a
bluff overlooking the sea at Ul-san in Kyŭng-sang Province.
He named it To-san. The Chinese Yang Ho determined to
cut the war short by attacking and taking this position and
by so doing he expected to cut off the right arm of the invading
army. Collecting all the forces that were within reach,
he started south to attack Ul-san. The army consisted of
40,000 men and it went in three divisions. The left or eastern
division being led by Gen. Yi Pang-ch‘ŭn, the middle
division by Gen. Ko Ch‘ak and the western division by Gen.
P ăng U-dŭk. Gen. Ma Kwi was sent on ahead and acted as
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>avant-coureur</em></span>. Stopping a few miles from the Japanese position
he ordered Gen. P‘a Sa to go and make a preliminary attack
upon the fort to discover something as to the lay of the
land, and if possible to discover the number and equipment of
the enemy. The attack was made with fire-arrows. Almost
immediately the Japanese made a sortie, but were driven back
with a loss of four hundred and sixty men. Shortly after
this the three grand army corps arrived. The Japanese were
arranged in three divisions. In the middle was the fort proper.
On the north was a fortified camp called the Pan-gu-jun
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>and off the south was another called the P‘a-wha-gang. It
was the first business of the Chinese and Korean allies to
drive these outer divisions into the central fort. To this end
the left division of the army attacked the Pan-gu-jun and the
right division the <a id='corr36.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='T a-wha-gang'>P‘a-wha-gang</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_36.4'>P‘a-wha-gang</a></span>. Gen. Yang Ho put on his
armor and went into the thick of the fight and urged on his
men. The air was filled with the noise of drums, musketry-fire
and shouts of the combatants, and a cloud of arrows
concealed the heavens. Some of the Japanese huts were on
fire and great clouds of smoke and flame rolled heavenward.
Slowly the Japanese were forced back and finally they all entered
the gates of the main fort of To-san. This fort was set
on a rugged hill where it was difficult for an attacking force
to manoeuvre, but there was little water in the fort and the
Japanese were forced to come out secretly at night and draw
water from a well nearby. Being aware of this, Gen. Kim
Eung-sŭ, a Korean, placed an ambush about the well and
caught upwards of a hundred of the enemy. They were badly
emaciated and said that surrender was a matter of only a
few days. It came on to rain, and this was followed by
severe cold, as it was now the beginning of winter. Many of
the besieging army had their hands and feet frozen. One
of Gen. Konishi’s lieutenants wrote repeatedly to the Korean
general Song Yun-mun asking for terms of peace. Gen.
Yang Ho answered, “Konishi must come out and surrender
and he will be treated well.” By this time the Japanese were
well-nigh exhausted. They had neither food nor water, and
every day they died in such numbers that it is said they had
“a mountain of dead.” Many a time Gen. Konishi meditated
suicide but each time was restrained by one means or another.
As a last resort the Japanese threw gold and silver over the
wall to bribe the soldiers without and keep them from making
an attack.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the tables were about to be turned. All the other
Japanese forces in the south had become aware of the desperate
straits to which their comrades were reduced at To-san.
And so now at the last moment a large fleet appeared and the
hard won victory was snatched from between the teeth of the
Chinese and Korean allies. The exposure had greatly weakened
the besieging force. Their provisions were almost exhausted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>and they had used up all their arrows. They were
far stronger <a id='corr37.2a'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='that'>than</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_37.2a'>than</a></span> the <a id='corr37.2b'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>beleagured</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_37.2b'>beleagured</a></span> Japanese but were not fit to
cope with the fresh army which was burning with zeal to
avenge their starving compatriots. So it was that Gen. Yang
Ho was compelled to raise the siege and fall back toward
Seoul. During this siege the Chinese loss was fourteen
hundred, though many thousands were wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>From this time date the first efforts of the Roman Catholic
Church to enter Korea. Japan had already many thousands
of converts to Romanism and Hideyoshi was determined to
leave no means untried to eradicate the foreign cult. To this
end he sent many of the Catholic converts to Korea. But the
most distinguished of them all was the young and vigorous
Gen. Konishi who had received baptism at the hands of the
Catholics and had received the name of Augustine Arimandano.
It may have been because of Hideyoshi’s desire to get
the Catholics out of the country that Gen. Konishi was appointed
to the post in Korea. Kato was as pronounced a Buddhist
as Konishi was a Christian and this of course intensified
the hatred and rivalry between them. Gen. Konishi was desirous
of having Catholic teachers come over to the peninsula
and attend to the spiritual needs of the Christians in the army;
and to this end the Vice-provincial of the Jesuits in Japan appointed
Padre Gregoris de Cespedes to this arduous and important
post. With him went a Japanese priest. The two
first went to Tsushima and finding no means of getting to the
peninsula remained there over the winter and carried on a
successful mission work. The next spring they made their
way to Korea and finally reached Gen. Konishi’s headquarters
at a place that the Japanese call Comangai, which was
without doubt the fort of Ul-san. Here they worked a year
but finally, through the machinations of Gen. Kato, who worked
upon the prejudices of Hideyoshi, both the foreign and native
priests were sent back to Japan, and this had no little to
<a id='corr37.35'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='to'>do</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_37.35'>do</a></span> with the return of Gen. Konishi, who went to clear himself
before his master.</p>

<p class='c000'>To anticipate a little, we might here say that many Koreans
who were carried captive to Japan from time to time
during this war, became Christians at Nagasaki and though
slaves were so firm in their belief as to be willing to suffer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>martyrdom during the terrible persecutions which raged in
Japan between 1610 and 1630, but with the departure of <a id='corr38.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Cespides'>Cespedes</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_38.2'>Cespedes</a></span>
from Korea the distinctive work in Korea was abandoned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Let us pause a moment here to compare the two contending
armies. In this second invasion the total number of Japanese
that reached Korean soil was 105,400, or about half
as many as formed the first army of invasion. They were led
by twenty-seven generals, prominent among whom were
Kato and Konishi. As a mark of his spiteful spirit, Hideyoshi
ordered that in this second invasion the noses and ears of
all Koreans killed or captured should be cut off and sent to
Japan. And so from time to time these half-savage soldiers
sent loads of Korean noses and ears, pickled in salt, and they
were buried in the monastery of Ta-bul-sa in the city of Kyoto,
there to remain to all ages a disgusting memento of the
most unprovoked and wanton cruelty that ever disgraced the
annals of a great people. Many of the Koreans who lost their
noses or ears at that time survived many years, and it cannot
be wondered at that the Koreans have never since cared to
accept favors at the hands of their island neighbors.</p>

<p class='c000'>The total number of Chinese was 210,000. With them
came 2,000,000 ounces of silver to pay for their sustenance.
From Shantung were sent by boat 200,000 bags of rice. There
were also sent for the relief of the army 5,832,000 ounces of
silver. And for the relief of the Korean famine sufferers an
additional 3,000,000 ounces were sent. When we consider
the vast number of men and the millions of wealth that China
poured into Korea at this time it may well be believed, as the
Koreans affirm, that China, by so doing, impoverished herself
so that she became an easier prey to the Manchus who, a few
years later, wrested the scepter from her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Large numbers of Japanese who had been in the country
for years and were tired of the war deserted from the ranks,
married Korean women and settled down to farming in various
places in the south. At Mi-ryang in the Province of
Kyŭng-sang there was a whole settlement of them. It was
called the Hang-wă or “Settlement of the Surrendered Japanese.”
Some of them were also to be found in Ham-gyŭng
and P‘yŭng-an Provinces. These had been left behind and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>abandoned by their fellows for one cause or another when the
Japanese retired from the north. They were all destined to be
destroyed a quarter of a century later during the rebellion of
Yi Kwal.</p>

<p class='c000'>About this time there arose in the Chinese court a determined
enemy of Gen. Yang Ho named Chŭng Eung-t‘ă who
accused Gen. Yang to the Emperor in twenty-five specifications,
five of which implicated the king of Korea and which
at a later date caused a deal of trouble.</p>

<p class='c000'>We now enter upon a new phase of the war, the closing
epoch. In the first moon of the following year, 1598, the
Emperor sent two admirals to Korea, the one being Tong Il-wun
and the other Chil Lin. The former was to have charge
of the naval operations off the coast of Chŭl-la and the other
of those off Kyŭng-sang Province. Chil Lin, under the title
of Great Admiral came up the Han River with 500 boats as
far as Tong-jak, the first village above Yong-san. The king
and the court went down and reviewed this fleet and saw it
start off to join Admiral Yi Sun-sin in the south. This admiral,
Chil Lin, was a good soldier but inordinately vain.
He would take no one’s advice, and it looked as if stormy times
were in store for the plain, blunt Admiral Yi. The king told
Admiral Chil Lin that he was not sure about Admiral Yi, and
this of course had its influence with the Chinese admiral.
Admiral Yi was then at Ko-geum Island off Chŭl-la Province.
When he heard that Admiral Chil Lin was coming he showed
by his first act that he was as good a diplomat as soldier. He
may or may not have known what sort of man the Chinese
admiral was but he knew that in any case it would not do to
antagonize him, and he acted accordingly. He collected
a great store of fish and game and wine and went out to meet
the approaching fleet. Returning with the Chinese admiral he
spread a great feast and the whole company got splendidly
drunk and vowed that Admiral Yi was a royal good fellow.
Admiral Chil Lin himself joined in the praise. Soon after
this Admiral Yi had the good luck to take two score of Japanese
heads, but instead of claiming the honor himself he
handed them over to the Chinese admiral to forward as his
own trophies. This finished Admiral Yi’s conquest of Admiral
Chil Lin’s good graces. From this time on it was Gen.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Yi who suggested and planned and it was Admiral Chil Lin
who assented and reaped the praise. This course of conduct
was a master-piece of genius on the part of Admiral Yi, for
by so doing he accomplished at least three important things.
In the first place he kept himself in his position, which he
would have lost had he antagonized the Chinaman. In the second
place he saved himself to his country at a time when she
could not have spared him. He was willing to forego the
praise and let others reap the commendation if only he might
ward off the enemies of his country. In the third place he
made the Chinese seem successful and so encouraged them
and got out of them for Korea all that was to be hoped. He
was willing to seem to be toadying to Admiral Chil Lin when
in reality that gentleman was, to use a pregnant Korean
phrase, “in his sleeve.” Being always near the Chinese admiral
he could always see to it that no great blunders were
made. At first the Chinese soldiery committed great excesses
among the people of the country, stealing their valuables and
otherwise injuring them. Admiral Yi quietly asked that the
discipline of the army be put in his hands and from that day on
the smallest irregularity was severely punished and the most
perfect order prevailed. This did not escape the eye of Admiral
Chil Lin, and he wrote to the king that Admiral Yi was
a remarkable man and that the world did not contain another
soldier like him. One day as they sat in a summer-house
overlooking the sea a fleet of Japanese boats appeared in the
distance. Admiral Chil Lin was much excited and a little
nervous but Admiral Yi laughed and said, “Sit here and watch
me give those fellows a whipping.” He got out his boats and
in an hour he had forty of the enemy’s boats on fire and the
rest fled. Admiral Chil Lin could not praise him enough after
this and declared that the universe did not contain another
man who could perform the feats that Admiral Yi apparently
found easy.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the seventh moon of this year the enemies of Gen.
Yang Ho in Nanking were successful and he was called from
Korea, much to the regret of the king who vainly sent an envoy
to the Chinese court specially to plead that the decree be not
carried out. Gen. Yang had been the best of all the generals
that China had sent and his departure was a great loss to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Korea. When he went, the king and a large number of the
people accompanied him beyond the Peking Pass, and a stone
tablet was raised there in his <a id='corr41.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='honur'>honour</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_41.3'>honour</a></span>. All of this of course
made Gen. Yang’s enemies hate the king as well, and so that
official named Chung Eung-t’a fabricated some astonishing
stories about him. He claimed that while he had been in
Korea he had found a manuscript which proved that the king
had received investiture from Japan. He also charged the
Koreans with showing disloyalty to China by prefixing the
word <em>ta</em> (great) to the posthumous titles of their kings. He
also claimed that the first coming of the Japanese was with a
secret understanding with the king of Korea that they would
attack Liao-tung together. To these he added many minor
charges. The Emperor apparently believed these things and
immediately despatched an envoy, So Kwal-lan, to investigate
the matter and report. When the king was informed of these
charges he was dumbfounded. All his scrupulous care of the
interests of his Chinese suzerain and the extremes of hardship
which he and his people had endured, rather than grant the
Japanese a free passage through Korea to strike China—all
this was thrown back upon him and his devotion was counted
treachery. He left his palace and took up his abode in a straw
hut for one whole month as penance for having been even
suspected of such baseness. The whole country was stirred
to its depths by these unnatural and evidently baseless charges.
The king immediately sent his most trusted councillors Yi
Hang-bok and Yi Chung-gwi to Nanking with the following
memorable reply to the charges which had been preferred:</p>

<p class='c000'>“These charges which have been made against me are
very grave and if they are true I deserve death. In order to
answer them I must repeat them, even though it defile my
mouth. In the first place the origin of the Japanese is far in
the eastern sea. The way thither by boat is exceeding far.
They are such barbarians that heaven has separated them far
from other men. They have always been bad neighbors, for
they live by piracy; they come like a flash and are gone as
suddenly. Since the time of the fall of the Koryŭ dynasty
great uneasiness has prevailed in Japan. Law has been in
abeyance and bands of freebooters have been allowed to devastate
our southern shores until nothing but weeds and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>briers grow there. The founder of our present dynasty drove
them out for a time but they grew bold again and continued
their depredations. The natives of Tsushima liked to come
and trade with us and we permitted it at their request; then
Japanese from the more distant islands came in flocks like
birds. Our people never liked them, but we permitted the
trade, as it was mutually profitable. We gave them rice to
eat and treated them kindly. We built a house in Seoul for
the reception of their envoys. In the days of king Se-jong
they asked us to send an envoy to Japan and we did so, primarily
to spy out the land and discover whether the country
was rich or poor, strong or weak. The envoy obtained the
information and we immediately reported the matter to China.
We could not well refuse to send an envoy to Japan, but it
does not argue relations of friendship, much less of intimacy.
In the days of the Emperor Chong-t’ong the Japanese started
to ravage a <a id='corr42.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='cerain'>certain</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_42.16'>certain</a></span> part of the Chinese coast and took Quelpart
on the way, but we attacked and drove them out and sent
their leader alive to China to be dealt with. Also in the time
of King Chung-jong the Japanese attacked the China coast at
Yong P’a-bu. They killed the Chinese general and then
made off, but we caught them and sent them to the Chinese
authorities. Since that time we have twice prevented Japanese
attacks on the China coast. Not once nor twice have we
received high commendation from the Chinese Emperor for
our firm loyalty. We have always used our wits and our
strength in the interests of China. This was the duty of a
vassal and this we have done. We let the Japanese live in
the three harbors of Ch’e-p’o, Pu-san-p’o and Yŭm-p’o but we
prescribed limits of five or ten <em>li</em> beyond which they could not
go. On the whole then is seems plain that the charge that
we called in the Japanese and asked them for troops must be
a pure fabrication. Again the book which Chung Eung-t’a
claims to have found is an actual book and is named the Ha-dong
Keui-ryak. It was written by Sin Suk-ju the envoy to
Japan, on his return from that country, and it deals with the
laws and manners of the Japanese. It contains a map of
Japan, a genealogy and also the rules of etiquette to be observed
toward the Japanese envoy. This book our accuser seized
upon as a sure sign of our leaning toward Japan, and he twisted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>its meaning to correspond to his theory. The Japanese
have a different name for the year from that which we use,
and the writer of this book put the Chinese name beneath
the Japanese name as a sort of commentary, so that the reader
could understand what year was referred to. In a Japanese
book one must put the Japanese name of the year and if he
wants to make plain the meaning he must put the Chinese
name underneath or in the margin. As to the charge that we
gave too high a title to our deceased kings we can only say
that we live beyond the sea and are ignorant and secluded.
From the days of Sil-la until now we have been accustomed
to name our dead kings in this way. The founder of the
dynasty was scrupulously careful not to overstep the recognized
limits of his authority as a vassal of China and we never
for a moment have forgotten the gap which separates a vassal
king from his suzerain. The custom of giving these posthumous
titles dates from the days of Sil-la, so how could we be
expected to know that it was wrong, especially as it has never
been called in question before? If we are blamed for ignorance
and boorishness we cry guilty, but if for lack of loyalty,
we humbly deny it. We have our calendar, our official dress
and writing all from China. This alone should speak for our
loyalty. The year before the beginning of the present war
Hideyoshi murdered his master and usurped his throne. Burning
with a desire to spring at the throat of China he sent us
letters inviting us to join in an invasion of that country. We
sent his letter back with contumely. In all this we advanced
solely the interests of China. This is as clear as day. When
the invading army came it seemed as if all Japan had alighted
upon our shores. They covered our whole eight provinces
and ravaged them. They seized our three capitals and desecrated
two royal tombs. They burned our ancestral temple
and other sacred places and then swept northward to P’yŭng
Yang. We were unable to hold them in check or save our
capital from their hands. We were driven to the verge of
desperation and were about to cross into the parent land to
die. Is it conceivable that if we had the least friendship for
Hideyoshi we would have suffered all this at his hands? If
we look at nature do we find any analogy for such a thing?
If this charge is true why did our forces join with yours in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>striking the invaders and why have we been hanging on their
flanks and harassing them for years? Let the Emperor know
that there is a reason why we have suffered this slander at
the mouth of Chung Eung-t’a. It is because we took Gen.
Yang Ho’s part when Chung Eung-t’a desired his recall from
Korea in disgrace. Gen. Yang Ho was with us a long time
and he was a true friend of Korea. We all had the utmost
confidence in him and it was a great pity that so good a man
should have met the reward he did. It is a cause of poignant
grief to us. We are a small people and our destruction is a
matter of small consequence, but for a general of China to be
treated in this manner is a serious matter. We are an outside
people and we have never had the pleasure of visiting the
Emperor’s court, and so there is no one to plead our cause
for us, but the Emperor will be able to judge our case without
further plea. Chung Eung-t’a has called me a traitor,
and I would rather die than live with such a charge upon me,
even though it be untrue. Let the Emperor take this letter
and sit in judgment on the case and if it appears that I am
guilty let my head pay the penalty, but if not then let the
Emperor acquit me before the world and I shall again be able
to endure the light of day.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This letter is clear, logical and to the point, and it
breathes a spirit of self-respect which does credit to the king.
It shows not a servile dependence but a true self-respecting
loyalty, and in the firm denial of the charges and the final
demand for condemnation or public <a id='corr44.25'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>acquital</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_44.25'>acquital</a></span> there is the ring
of genuine manhood which would do honor to any man in
any age.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Emperor read this letter his judicial mind found
in it the ring of conscious rectitude and like the man he was
he instantly <a id='corr44.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='acknowleged'>acknowledged</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_44.30'>acknowledged</a></span> his error. He ordered the letter to
be printed by the thousands and tens of thousands and scattered
broadcast over his empire, for he apparently felt it a personal
honor to have so true and genuine a man for a vassal.
He answered the letter in the following terms:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believed the words of slander spoken by that small
man Chung Eung-t‘a, and doubted in my mind as to the loyalty
of the king of Korea. I cannot now be oblivious to the
unmerited sufferings of Gen. Yang Ho. Chung Eung-t‘a is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>a radically bad man. I was on the brink of a disastrous mistake.
I will now deprive him of rank and make him one of
the common herd. Let him appear before me at once.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When Chung Eung-t‘a arrived in <a id='corr45.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Naking'>Nanking</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_45.4'>Nanking</a></span> he was cut in

<p class='c007'>By this time the Japanese were becoming mixed with the
Korean people among whom and near whom their camps were
placed. They were probably good customers and the people
doubtless felt that it was not their business to fight them; so
all up and down the coast for a distance of three hundred
miles the Japanese lived in their “holes” as the Koreans called
them, and in many cases they took wives from among the
women of the country and devoted themselves to farming, except
at such times as the Korean or Chinese forces came into
their vicinity. There were three Japanese military centers.
One was at Ul-san on the eastern coast, held by Konishi. In
the west was Sun-ch‘ŭn <a id='corr45.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='ni'>in</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_45.27'>in</a></span> Chŭl-la Province where Kato had
his headquarters, while half way between these two in the
town of Sa-ch‘un on the Si-jin River a third station was held
by Gen. Sok Mang-ja. These three stations kept up regular
communication with each other, and in case of need rendered
each other assistance.</p>

<p class='c000'>We now enter the last campaign of this eventful war.
We are not informed as to the numbers of the Japanese at this
time but it probably fell short of 100,000 men. The Chinese
had assembled again in force at Seoul and in the ninth moon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>of 1598 a grand move was made against the invaders. The
Chinese forces were led by Generals Hyöng Kă and Man Se-dŭk.
The whole army was divided into four grand army
corps. Gen. Ma Kwi led the eastern division southward to
attack Ul-san. Under him were eleven other generals and
24,000 men.</p>

<p class='c000'>The central division, of 13,000 men, was led by Gen.
Tong Il-wŭn under whom were eight other generals. The
western division was led by Gen. Yu Chung and six other generals
with a force of 13,000 men. The admiral of this campaign
was Chil Lin who was already in the south with eight
other commanders handling 13,200 men. It is said that the
entire expedition numbered 142,700 men, but the above items
sum up to less than half that and we must conclude that there
were something less than 100,000 men in all.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the last day of the ninth moon, already well on toward
winter, the three divisions deployed before the walls of
Ul-san. Kato had not been idle all this time; after the terrible
scenes of the last siege he had made the best of preparations.
He had accumulated an abundance of food, increased
the garrison, strengthened the defenses, and he could laugh
at any force that should try to sit out the winter before him.
The Chinese soon discovered this and turned aside to work
that promised better success. Gen. Tong Il-wŭn took a
powerful force and advanced on Sa-chŭn, the central station
of the Japanese. It is probable that the garrison here was
smaller than those under either Kato or Konishi, for when
its commander saw the force that was brought to bear upon
him he hastily evacuated the place and crossed over to the
island of Pom-neut and fortified it. Gen. Tong was over-confident
and pressed after him. The Japanese craftily drew
him on and on until his force was immediately under the wall,
when a mine was exploded which, though it killed but a few
hundred men, threw the whole attacking body into such confusion
that the Japanese rushed out and found them an easy
prey. The Chinese lay in heaps where they had been cut
down. Gen. Tong barely escaped with his life and fled to
Sam-gă, being chased as far as the Nam-gang (river) where
the Japanese contented themselves with making way with
12,000 bags of rice belonging to the Chinese commissariat.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Gen. Yu Chung was commissioned to take a strong body
of men and attack the fortress at Sun-ch‘ŭn in Chŭl-la Province.
Arriving at the neighboring village of Wă-gyo he
determined to overcome the old veteran Kato by treachery.
He sent to that general a proposition to make peace. Kato
was now an old man and the war in Korea was bringing him
neither fame nor advancement, so he was ready to give up
the contest, now that it had been demonstrated that the Japanese
arms could not penetrate the north. He gladly assented
and sent Gen. Yu a present of two handsome <a id='corr47.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='swords'>swords.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_47.10'>swords.</a></span>
It was agreed that they should meet at a certain point, accompanied
by only 3000 men each; but Gen. Yu secretly
placed an ambush in such wise that when the Japanese force
should come out it could be cut off from return to the fort.
A whistle was to be sounded as a signal when the Japanese
came out. But Kato was too old a bird to be caught by such
a child’s trick. He had seen two or three of the Chinese
lurking about in the vicinity of the gate and so delayed his
coming out. By mistake the signal was given and the Chinese
ambuscade rushed out only to become an object of ridicule
to the Japanese. But even as it was some eighty or ninety
Japanese stragglers were cut off and taken by the Chinese.
Gen. Yu then surrounded the stronghold and at the same
time sent an urgent letter to Admiral Chil Lin to come that
very night and join in an attack on the Japanese. The
admiral obeyed the summons and hurried up with his fleet.
Not knowing about the tides and supposing that the shouts
that he heard were the shouts of battle, he sailed straight up
under the walls of the fortress. But he found that there was
no fight on for Gen. Yu had failed to connect, and the ebbing
tide left the astonished Admiral high and dry on the mud
flats under the very noses of the enemy. In the morning the
Japanese trooped out and burned forty-eight of the stranded
ships and killed most of the men. Admiral Chil escaped in
the early morning by boat and hurried to the camp of his
tardy compatriot, Gen. Yu. In a rage he tore down with his
own hands that general’s flag and rent it in pieces, meanwhile
heaping upon him every species of abuse for having gotten
him into such a plight. Gen. Yu was exceedingly ashamed
and his face, they say, was “the color of dirt.” He beat upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>his breast and acknowledged that he deserved death. So
Chil Lin went back to his decimated camp to nurse his
wrath.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Gen. Yu knew that Kato really desired to put an
end to the war, and so he sent another messenger saying,
“This time I really mean peace. If you will take all your
forces and depart I will give you a clear path to escape. Our
army numbers 140,000 men and you cannot hope to face that
number.” To this proposition Kato assented and began immediately
to embark his soldiers to send them back to Japan.
But as it happened they had to pass the position of Admiral
Chil Lin who naturally sallied out and gave fight, sinking or
burning a dozen or more of Kato’s boats. The rest put back
in haste to the starting place and Kato blamed Gen. Yu for
having deceived him; but the latter claimed that he had merely
forgotten to inform Admiral Chil Lin of the agreement and
that he would do so. At the same time he advised Kato to
send Admiral Chil a slight testimonial of regard, which he did
in the shape of a hundred ounces of silver and forty-five
swords. So Admiral Chil acquiesced. Again the Japanese
fleet set out and succeeded in getting by Admiral Chil Lin’s
place; but they had not reckoned upon Admiral Yi Sun-sin
and his faithful warriors. Kato was again obliged to turn
back and go to work to bribe that doughty leader. He sent
him guns and swords in large numbers but the old gentleman
remarked that as for weapons he was already pretty well supplied,
and sent them back. He was then approached with an
offer of 1,000 ounces of silver if he would wink at Kato’s passage.
This he likewise refused.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Japanese were all embarked and it was determined
to try and slip by the terrible Admiral in the gray of morning;
but he was well aware of the intentions of the enemy,
and before break of day he massed all the ships at his command
and came down upon the Japanese fleet as it lay at
anchor before the fortress of Sun-ch’ŭn. As he approached
he is said to have uttered the following prayer to his gods:
“To-day I am to die. Give me but one more victory over
these Japanese and I shall die content.” He well knew that
he had enemies at court who would eventually secure his
downfall and so he determined to make an end in one last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>desperate struggle. The fight was short and fierce and when
the morning breeze swept the smoke of battle away it disclosed
fifty of the Japanese boats in flames and the water filled
with struggling forms. The old veteran had taken upwards
of two thousand heads in that brief time. But Gen.
Kato had slipped away in a small boat and made his escape.
The work however was only begun. The sea was covered
with boats frantically endeavoring to escape from the dreaded
arm of the merciless Admiral Yi. The good work went on
and every hour added to the score that Admiral Yi had sworn
to made before the night should fall. Notice reached him
that a fresh Japanese fleet had come and was attacking Admiral
Chil Lin’s fleet. Hurrying thither he found that it was
indeed true. He now changed his tactics and without coming
to a hand to hand fight he circled round and round the
Japanese fleet driving them closer and closer together. When
all was ready he began playing upon them with a new
machine of his own manufacture called the pun-t’ong or
“spraying tube.” What this was we can not exactly discover,
but in a short time it sufficed to set the Japanese fleet on
fire. A wind sprang up and fanned the flame and ere long
the Japanese fleet was one mass of fire. Hundreds of boats
were consumed with all their occupants. After seeing this
well under way Admiral Yi turned his attention to the fugitive
craft that were striving to make their escape. Standing
in the prow of his boat in an exposed position he urged
on the chase. While he stood in the midst of one of the
grandest victories of the war, he was pierced by a bullet.
They caught him as he fell, and his last words were, “Do not
let the rest know that I am dead, for it will spoil the fight.”
Then he expired—the man who may well be called the <span class='sc'>Nelson</span>
of Korea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yi Wan, the nephew of the fallen Admiral, still urged on
the battle; but the work was almost done. The fugitive
boats became fewer and fewer. Admiral Chil Lin happened
to come near the boat of the dead admiral and noticing that
the sailors in it were quarrelling over some Japanese heads he
exclaimed, “The Admiral must be dead.” He entered the
boat and found it even so. Throwing himself three times at
full length on the deck he uttered this lament: “I thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>that he would save me and still live, but here he lies dead and
there is no soldier now left in Korea.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We have now come to the end of actual hostilities in the
peninsula but we must cross to Japan and inquire into the
immediate causes which led to the final recall of all the Japanese
troops. The Korean account of these events is very remarkable
and faith is to be put in it only in-so-far as it is not
directly antagonized by the Japanese account. For events
that transpired in Korea the Korean account must be taken
as the standard, but for events that transpired in Japan the
Japanese account must of course be accepted as the more
trustworthy. The Korean account is as follows.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><em>THE FARRIER.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>When the Japanese first invaded Korea, in the year 1592,
it so happened that a young Korean boy named Yang Pu-ha,
a native of Tong-nă, became attached to the Japanese army
as a slave, and was eventually taken to <ins class='correction' title='Tsushima'>Tsushima.</ins> From
there he made his way to the mainland of Japan and at
last reached the court of Hideyoshi. That observant man
spied him out and said, “Korean and Japanese boys resemble
each other strongly. Take this boy and teach him Japanese,
and if he does not learn well cut off his head.” With this incentive
it would be strange if a less intelligent boy than
Yang Pu-ha would not learn rapidly. In the space of three
months he could converse creditably in Japanese, and Hideyoshi
as reward made him one of his body-servants. For some
years the boy performed the duties of this position, until at last
the Chinaman Sim Yu-gyŭng arrived. That official was kept
practically in confinement at the court of Hideyoshi. One day
the Korean servant asked his master to be allowed to see Sim
Yu-gyŭng. Permission was granted and the young man found
the Chinese envoy in great perplexity, in fact in tears. This
excited the pity of the young man and he secured the release
of the Chinaman, who from that time was often called into
the presence of Hideyoshi, with whom he soon became on <a id='corr50.34'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='familar'>familiar</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_50.34'>familiar</a></span>
terms. One day as he sat with the great Taiko he took
out a pill and swallowed it. He did the same on several days
in succession until at last the curiosity of Hideyoshi was excited
and he asked what it was. The Chinaman answered
that it was an antidote to indigestion and that by eating it
the strength and vigor of the body was preserved intact. Hideyoshi
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>took one in his hand and eyed it suspiciously. On one
side of the pill was written the Chinese character <em>so</em> meaning
“hot.” The Japanese deliberately took a knife and cut the
pill in two and handing half to Sim said, “You eat half and
I will eat half.” Its immediate effects were stimulating and
pleasant but in the end it proved a deadly <a id='corr51.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='poision'>poison</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_51.6'>poison</a></span> for it slowly
dried up the blood. Each day Sim shared one with his
captor but upon retiring to his room swallowed a potion
which entirely neutralized the effect of the poison. Before
long Hideyoshi’s hands began to grow hard and dry and one
day when he happened to cut his hand he was astonished to
find that no blood followed. He called for a moxa and applied
it to his hand and yet no blood came. Then he laughed
aloud and cried, “I am a dead man. When I cease to breathe
take out my bowels and sew my body up again with horse-hair;
and then preserve my body in wine and do not let the
outsiders know that I am dead.” He wanted to have the fact
concealed for he feared it would have a dispiriting effect upon
the troops in Korea. Shortly after this he died and his orders
were minutely carried out. For two months no one outside
the palace knew of his decease, but at last the stench became
so great that they confessed that the great Hideyoshi had
passed away. Such is the Korean story.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Koreans sum up his character as follows: He was a
crafty and cunning man, and by his talk, now sharp, now
suave, now sarcastic, now bullying, he managed to sway the
minds of all who came near him. He managed all his generals
like puppets. He liked to take boys and girls under his patronage
and see them grow up together and marry them to
each other and thus have them completely under his control.
His two most powerful generals were Whi Wŭn and Ka Kang.
They hated him and would have been glad of an opportunity
to overthrow him, but it was out of the question. He knew
them well, and for fear they might combine against him he
made one of them governor of the east and the other of the
west and ordered them to keep watch of each other. By thus
pitting them against each other he made himself safe. He
loved intrigue and diplomacy and had a most restless temperament.
He was ever on the lookout for some kind of excitement.
Gen. Ka Kang was with him when he died, and, fearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>lest rebellion should break out, he filled the body with salt
and so preserved it. He made a wooden form which would
hold the body stiff in a sitting position and placing it in a
place where the light was not very bright with the eyes wide
open, the people saw him sitting there day after day and supposed
of course he was alive. It was in the eighth moon when
the odor was so strong that the truth could no longer be concealed.
Thereupon Gen. Ka Kang took the son of Hideyoshi
and made him Shogun. He then threw into prison the wives
and children of Generals Kato and Konishi and sent a messenger
ordering them to collect all their troops and return immediately
to Japan. The order was obeyed willingly and all
that was left of the Japanese army of invasion set sail from
Fusan, and the great invasion was a thing of the past.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Korean annalists say that when the invasion began
the Japanese arms were far superior to those of Korea; also
that the Japanese displayed tiger skins, pheasant feathers,
gilded masks and plumes; all which glitter and show terrified
the Koreans. Thus at first the Japanese had an easy victory,
but toward the last it was not so. The Koreans had improved
their arms and had learned not to fear the grand rush of
the Japanese in their hideous masks which made them look
more like demons than men.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the time of the second invasion a Korean named Kang
Han was caught and sent to Japan and, being unable to escape,
he set to work learning Japanese. He became a teacher
of Chinese and had a large following of students who treated
him very well and supported him in comfortable style. At
the end of the war they clubbed together and bought a boat
into which they put this man with all his goods and sent him
back to Korea. On his return he wrote a book entitled Kang
yang-rok or “Relation of Adventures among Sheep,” a sarcastic
pleasantry.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chinese arms in Korea did not move till the following
spring, and then the king sent to the Emperor asking
that Generals Man Se-dok, Ta Cham and Yi Sung-hun be allowed
to remain in Korea for a time until things should become
thoroughly settled.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the early centuries of the Christian era there was a
celebrated Chinese general named Kwan U. He was of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>gigantic size and had a fiery red face, rode a powerful red horse,
could walk a thousand li a day (!) and carried a sword that
weighed 800 pounds (!!). It is said that while the Japanese
were occupying Seoul the spirit of this great man appeared
repeatedly near the South and East Gates and struck terror
to the hearts of the Japanese. Now, as the Chinese generals
were about to leave for China, Admiral Chil Lin built a shrine
to this same Kwan U outside the South Gate. In the thirty-third
year of King Sun-jo, namely 1600 A. D., the Emperor
sent four million cash to build a temple to this Kwan U and
the present temple outside the South Gate was erected. The
Emperor at the same time ordered another to be built by the
Koreans outside the East Gate, and it was done. The two
temples are exactly alike. When the king asked the Emperor
to name the temple he said “Call it the Hyöng-nyung-so dok-kwan-gong”
which means “The great and bright appearance
of the spirit of Kwan.” The king also built shrines to him
in Song-ju and An-dong of Kyŭng-sang Province, and at
Nam-wŭn in Chŭl-la Province.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have already seen that factious fights had been a great
cause of weakness all through the years of the invasion, and
from this time on party strife was destined to grow more and
more fierce and determined until it brought the country to the
very verge of anarchy a century later. We must note here
briefly the changes which had taken place in the parties. We
will remember that at first there were two parties, the Tong-in
and the Sŭ-in. During the war the court favorite was Yu
Sŭng-nyŭng who gave office to so many men from Kyŭng-sang
Province that the name of Nam-in or “South Men”
sprang up and a party by that name quickly became organized,
but their opponents in order to preserve the political
equilibrium instantly seized upon the name Puk-in or “North
Men.” At the close of the war the leader of the opposition,
namely of the Puk-in, memorialized the king against Yu
Sŭng-nyŭng the favorite, charging him with having desired
to make peace with the Japanese, contrary to the honor of the
country. The king listened to this and banished Yu, but his
supporters turned the tables by a counter-memorial in which
the charges were more than answered and Yu was restored to
all his honors. With the rise of the Nam-in and Puk-in parties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>the old party lines of the Tong-in and Sŭ-in had not been
broken up or lost. During the latter years of the invasion
the Nam-in party lost its powerful grip and the Puk-in were
often in power, but from the end of the invasion until far into
the following reign the Tong-in held the power, and after that
for a period of fifty years the Sŭ-in had control of affairs. It
may be asked what principles underlay these parties, what
settled policies they had that differentiated them either in
domestic or foreign matters. We answer that the various
parties had but one plank in their platforms, one settled plan
of action, and that was to get the ear of the king and seize
upon the office-making power and put in every position one’s
own partisans. It was the spoils system sublimated, for there
was absolutely no admixture of any other element.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now that the war was over the Japanese on Tsushima desired
to open again commercial relations with Korea, which
had always been mutually profitable; and so in the following
year, 1601, an envoy, Kuroda, came from that island bringing
with him three hundred men and women who had been
carried away captive during the war. This envoy asked that
there might be reciprocity of trade. The king referred the
matter to Nanking and the reply seems to have been in the
affirmative, for we find that soon after this an envoy was sent
over to Tsushima with credentials; but after all the Japanese
petition was not at this time granted. At the same time the
Emperor gave orders for the return to China of all the remaining
troops, but at the earnest request of the king 8000
men were left to help guard the southern provinces. Posthumous
honors were heaped upon Admiral Yi Sun-sin who
had been the very salvation of Korea, but who had sought
death in battle, knowing that if he lived his detractors
would drag him down. Yi Hang-bok and eighty-five others
received high commendation and additional honors also. The
year ended with the unsuccessful attempt of an insurrectionary
party in the south which was nipped in the bud, the ring-leader
being forwarded to <a id='corr54.36'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='seoul'>Seoul</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_54.36'>Seoul</a></span> to be beheaded.</p>

<p class='c000'>An unscrupulous man named Yu Yong-gyŭng was the
court favorite at this time and upon him devolved the task of
appointing and dismissing officials; consequently he was the
recipient of countless presents, and on one occasion two men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>to whom he had sold the same office met at his gate and quarrelled
over the matter, to the scandal of the court. The state of
affairs at the capital was anything but satisfactory, the reason
being that the strife of parties rendered honesty and fairness
impossible. It was a constant fight to gain the king’s ear
and, having gained it, to turn out all enemies and put in personal
adherents. About this time a remeasurement of all the
arable land of the country was ordered and it was discovered
that the total revenue of the country was 1,515,500 <em>kyul</em> of rice,
each <em>kyul</em> being about 120 pecks of rice, or over two hundred
pounds. It also included 300,000 bags of other grains.</p>

<p class='c000'>In <a id='corr55.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='they'>the</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_55.11'>the</a></span> year 1605 the Japanese again asked that a
treaty be made and that Korea send an envoy to the Japanese
court. The king complied and sent the same monk, Yu
Chung, ordering him to look carefully into the matter of the
military strength of the Island Empire and the distance by
boat. He returned the following year bringing with him,
it is said, three thousand Koreans who had been taken to
Japan from time to time during the invasion. The Korean
accounts tell us nothing of the booty that the Japanese carried
away to Japan during the war, nor of the transportation of
Korean artisans and their employment in Japan in teaching
the making of pottery and other works of use and art, but we
may well believe the Japanese reports, that assert that immense
amounts of treasure were carried away and that the
making of the beautiful Satsuma ware was an outcome of the
teaching of Korean artisans.</p>

<p class='c000'>This year was also signalized by a fierce conflict between
the savage tribe of Hol-cha-on, north of the Tu-man River,
and the government troops under Gen. Song U-gil. The latter
crossed the river by night and attacked the main settlement
of the tribe and utterly destroyed it, and effectually broke up
the tribe. Great quantities of goods which had been stolen
from the border settlements were also recovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>We are now on the threshold of events which led up to a
very painful period in Korean history. It will be remembered
that the king had no heir by the queen and had therefore
nominated to the throne his heir by a concubine, the Prince
Kwang-hŭ. This was a man of violent temper, bad instincts,
corrupt, selfish, careless of the pubic good. When therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>the king, in the fortieth year of his reign, was presented with
a son by his queen, his delight was as great as was the
chagrin of the heir apparent. According to law it was impossible
to set aside the man already nominated, but now that
the king finally got the boy he had been looking for so long,
his feelings got the better of his judgment and he was bent
upon having the child receive all the honors due to the future
wearer of the crown. So he sent out the order that officials
should come to the palace, and do obeisance as when an heir to
the throne is born. This was the most impolitic thing he
could have done, for it aroused all the hatred there was in the
Prince Kwang-hŭ, who had for so many years looked upon his
eventual occupancy of the throne as fully assured, and who
saw in these demonstrations of affection on the part of the
king a latent desire to change the decree which had already
gone forth. If the king really desired to set aside that decree
he should have sent to Nanking and had the Emperor do it,
but it was not so to be, and the infant boy entered the world
with one deadly enemy ranged against him, whose first act
would be to put him out of the way. Nor was it the boy alone
who gained the hatred of this prince. The queen herself became
the object of his special hatred, and the official who sent forth
the order that honor should be done to the infant.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Japanese kept urging their point, that relations of
mutual benefit be resumed, and kept protesting their good
intentions toward Korea. The king had just received an
envoy bringing gifts and a congratulatory letter from the
king of the Liu Kiu Islands, in which grave doubts were cast
upon the intentions of the Japanese, and an offer of assistance
was made in case of another invasion. But the king seems
not to have put faith in these doubts, and replied, to the reiterated
request of the Japanese, that an envoy would be sent
to Japan, when the men who desecrated the royal graves beyond
the Han River should be sent to the Korean Capital for
punishment. The Japanese went home, but returned late in
the fall bringing two men bound, whom they delivered over
as being the ones demanded. But these were mere boys who
themselves urged the fact that they were still babes in arms
when the deeds of which they were charged had been committed.
The Prime Minister urged the king to send them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>back to Japan, but the favorite, Yu, persuaded the king to
have them beheaded, after which Yö U-gil, Kyong Sŭn and
Chung Ho-gwan were sent as an embassy to Japan. Meanwhile
Iyeyasu in Japan had deposed the son of Hideyoshi
and usurped his place. So when the embassy arrived
in Japan they were received with the utmost coldness, and
the usurper said, “Who asked that envoys might be exchanged
between Japan and Korea? But now that you are
here we will receive you.” The treatment that they received
was bad almost beyond description. As a sample of the way
the Japanese baited them it is related that the Japanese
brought a dish filled with ordure sprinkled with something
the color of gold-dust, and when the Koreans innocently put
their hands in the dish, supposing that it was some form of
food, the Japanese had a good laugh at their expense. The
Koreans did not appreciate this sort of practical joke, and
forthwith returned to Korea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Late in the autumn the aged king was taken sick and all
knew that the end was near. The conditions were not propitious.
The young prince was only two years old and
Prince Kwang-hă was fierce in his resentments and jealous
of anyone who should attempt to block his path to the throne.
The people were in a very uneasy frame of mind. The king
had gone either too far or not far enough in the advocacy of
the infant prince, and now he felt that he was leaving the
child to the tender mercies of a relentless enemy. He therefore
called in the Prime Minister and said, “Everything looks
dark ahead and I am dying. I suppose the Prince Kwang-hă
must become king?” But the Prime Minister dared not
answer the question as the king wanted it answered, and
hung back. By so doing he sealed his own fate. There were
only two things for him to do, either to boldly advocate the
claims of the child or else boldly advocate those of Prince
Kwang-hă. By doing neither he made an enemy of the one
and spoiled the chances of the other, and thus signed his
own death warrant. As it happened, Prince Kwang-hŭ had
an elder brother, but why he had not been nominated to the
throne we are not told. This prince, named Im-hŭ, was now
induced to make the attempt to wrest the reins of power from
his brother so as to save the people from what they feared at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>the hands of Prince Kwang-hă, but the latter got wind of the
plot and the elder prince was summarily banished, together
with all his coadjutors.</p>

<p class='c000'>So matters went on until one day in early spring of the
following year, 1608, when a servant came from the king’s
private rooms saying that he was dying. All the officials
assembled at the palace. It is said that Prince Kwang-hă
had become impatient at the tenacity of life shown by the
aged king and had assisted nature in taking him off, but this, we
may surmise, is rather a general deduction from the character
of the man than a proved charge, and this prince has so much
else to answer for that we may well give him the benefit of
the doubt and conclude that the king reached his end by natural
causes alone. The assembled noblemen sat in the room
adjoining the one in which the king lay dying. Presently a
eunuch brought out a note which read thus, “When I am dead
let Prince Kwang-hă be kind to the infant boy.” When the
ministers had read it they sent it to the prince. Soon another
note came from the sick room, “To the seven ministers
of state; I am dying. I have but one cause of anxiety; the
boy is young and I shall not be here to see him come to manhood.
Let him be tenderly cared for.” This was the end.
The king turned to the wall and expired.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon hearing the welcome news the Prince Kwang-hă
hastened to assume the position he had coveted so long. His
first act was to send the Prime Minister Yu Yöng-gyŭng into
banishment. Then he sent an embassy to China to announce
his accession to the throne. The Emperor replied, “Why is
not the elder son, Prince Im-hă, made king?” and sent a
commission to inquire into the matter. Prince Im was brought
from Kyo-dong Island to which place he had been banished.
One of the creatures of the newly crowned king advised that
the head only of Prince Im be brought, but the aged Yi Hang-bok
opposed it so strongly that the king dare not follow his inclination;
but when Prince Im was brought he was “made
up” for the occasion. He was unkempt and filthy, his clothes
were in rags and the very sight of him decided the unsuspicious
commissioner and he ordered the wretched man to be sent
back to his place of banishment at once. For fear of further
complications and to satisfy his vengeful nature, the king sent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>a secret messenger to the prefect of Kyo-dong and had Prince
Im poisoned in prison. He next proceeded to kill the banished
Prime Minister, and then had his body brought to the
center of the capital and cut in half lengthwise.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Japanese had for several years been pressing for the
resumption of the old-time relations, half diplomatic and half
commercial, which had been carried on through the southern
port of Fusan. Now in the first year of the reign of Kwang-hă,
consent was gained and Yi Chi-wan for Korea and Gensho and
Yoshinao for Japan met and worked out a plan for a treaty.
The Japanese insisted that all three of the ports which
had formerly been open should again be opened, but this was
peremptorily refused and only Fusan was opened. The number
of boats that could come annually was reduced to twenty.
Great diplomatic agents from the Shogun were allowed to stay
in Korea one hundred and ten days. The agents from any
daimyo of Japan could stay eighty-five days and special agents
could stay fifty-five days. The strictness with which the Koreans
bound down the Japanese as to <a id='corr57.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='nmmber'>number</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_57.19'>number</a></span> of ships and
men and length of stay, and the refusal to open three ports,
show that Korea was doing this all more as a favor than by
demand, and history shows that at any time she felt at liberty
to withdraw support from them. The amount of rice and
other food that Korea granted was hardly more than enough
to support the embassy when it came.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be remembered that the king was the son of a concubine
and not of the queen. He now went to work to depose
the queen and set up his mother, though now dead, as
real queen. He gave his mother the posthumous title of
Kong-söng Wang-ho and sent the deposed queen into semi-banishment
to the Myŭng-ye Palace in Chong-dong, where the
king now resides. This act was looked upon as utterly unfilial
and godless by the officials, and they almost unanimously
censured his harsh treatment of this woman.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next three years were spent in killing off all who had
been specially favored under the last king, excepting the venerable
Yi Hang-bok, who stood so high in the esteem of the
people that even the wicked king did not dare to lay hands
upon him. One method of getting rid of objectionable people
was to promise release to some criminal if he would swear that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>he had heard the men conspiring against the king; but the
king’s thirst for blood could not be quenched so long as the
young prince was living. The latter was now six or seven
years old. No one dared to make a move against him openly,
but the officials knew that if they wanted to become favorites
with the king it could be done only by suggesting some plan
whereby the boy could be killed without bringing on a general
insurrection. It was accomplished as follows. Pak Eung-sŭ,
a well-known resident of Yŭ-ju became a highwayman.
He was captured and taken to Seoul for trial. After he had
been condemned, Yi I-ch‘ŭm the court favorite sent to him in
prison and said, “You are to die to-morrow, but if you will declare
that you and several other men have conspired to depose
the king and place the young prince on the throne you will
not only be released but rewarded as well.” When therefore
the king received the written confession of the wretch he
feigned surprise but instantly caught and executed the principals
named. His satellites also urged that he must kill the
young prince and his mother, for they must surely be privy
to the plot. And her father too must be beheaded. The king
did not dare to go to these lengths all at once, but he began
by beheading the queen’s father, and banishing the boy to
Kang-wha. When the men came to take him he hid beneath
his mother’s skirt but the brutal captors pushed her over and
dragged the lad away. These acts enraged the people almost
beyond endurance and memorials poured in upon the king
from people who preferred death itself to permitting such acts
to go unchallenged. The king however answered them one
and all by killing the writers or stripping them of rank and
banishing them.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the boy had been separated from his mother and banished
to Kang-wha, he could be dealt with at pleasure.
His death would remain unknown for a time, and the matter
would pass by unnoticed. So in the following year, at the
instigation of Yi I-ch’ŭm, the magistrate of Kang wha put the
boy in a small room, built a roaring fire under it and suffocated
him, an extreme of barbarity which the world can hardly
parallel. The news soon spread among the officials. Scores
of memorials poured in upon the king who answered them as
before by banishment and death.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the opening of the year 1615 the king further revealed
his hatred of the deposed and degraded queen by
publishing broadcast the statement that she had gone to the
grave of his mother and there, by practicing sorcery against
him, had tried to bring evil upon him. This also brought out
a loud protest from all honest men, and banishment followed.
Even the children on the street spoke insultingly of the tyrant
saying that he was afraid of the imps at the Myŭng-ye Palace,
but had let his mother stay there with them though he himself
would not go near the place. The king feared everyone
that was honest and upright even though they had nothing
to say. His own cousin, Prince Neung-ch’ang, whose younger
brother afterward became king, was a perfectly peaceable
and harmless man, but the king feared him and could not
rest satisfied until he had gotten his satellites to accuse him
of sedition and had suffocated him in a heated chamber on
Kyo-dong Island. About this time a monk, named Seung-ji;
gained the confidence of the superstitious king and induced
him to build the In-gyŭng Palace which is commonly known
among foreigners as the “Mulberry Palace.” To do this,
thousands of the houses of the common people were razed and
heavy taxes were levied throughout the country; and yet
there was not enough money. So the king began to sell the
public offices. Some were paid for in gold, others in silver,
others in iron, and still others in wood, stone or salt. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>people derisively called it the <em>O-hăng</em>, referring to the “Five
Rules of Conduct” of the Confucian Code. The boys also
made up a popular song which ran as follows, “Did you give
gold, or silver, or wood for yours?” and they put the officials
to shame by shouting it at them as they passed along the
street.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yi I-ch’ŭm, the favorite, could not rest until he had carried
out his master’s wish and had invented some way to destroy
the degraded Queen. Finding no other way to accomplish
this, he at last descended to the following trick. He instructed
a man named Hŭ Kyun to write a letter to the imprisoned
queen purporting to be from some party in the country, proposing
a scheme for deposing the king. This letter was
thrown over the wall of the queen’s enclosure and there found
by the servants of the crafty plotter. The king was ready to
believe anything against her and this letter fanned his hatred
into flame. Yi I-ch’ŭm followed it up by joining with scores
of others in memorials urging the king to put to death the
hated Queen Dowager. The Prime Minister, Keui Cha-hön,
stood in the way, however, and it became necessary to banish
him to the far north. In the eleventh moon the king finally
decided to drive the woman from Seoul, and made all the officials
give their opinion about it in writing. Nine hundred
and thirty officials and a hundred and seventy of the king’s
relatives advised to do so, but the aged Yi Hang-bok with
eight others utterly refused their sanction of the iniquitous
plan; and so these nine men, the last of those upright men
who had stood about the late king, were sent into banishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The year thus closed in gloom and the new one opened
with a memorial from the Prime Minister Ha Hyo-san enumerating
ten charges against the Queen Dowager: (1) that
she had had the officials do obeisance to the young prince although
the successor to the throne had already been appointed;
(2) when the king was dying she asked him to set aside
Prince Kwang-hă in favor of the young prince; (3) she prevented,
as long as possible, the king from handing over the
scepter to Prince Kwang-hă; (4) she wrote the letters purporting
to be from the dying king asking that the young prince
be carefully nurtured; (5) she instigated her father to conspire
against the king; (6) she sacrificed in the palace and prayed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>for the death of Prince Kwang-hă; (7) she prayed for the same
at the grave of his mother; (8) she corresponded with outside
parties with a view to raising an insurrection; (9) she sent to
the Emperor asking to have Prince Kwang-ă set aside, (10)
she sent to Japan asking that an army be sent to overthrow
the government.</p>

<p class='c000'>The king feigned to be very loath to believe all these
charges and to act upon them; he called heaven to witness
that the very thought of it was terrible to him and averred
that he would rather be banished to some distant shore than
even to mention such a thing. But after a great deal of urging
he was prevailed upon, and said he could no longer be
deaf to the entreaties of his subjects and the welfare of the
country. So he took away her title of Tă-bi and decreed that
she should be called Sŭ-gung “West Palace,” and that she
should receive no part of the government revenue, that officials
should no more do homage to her, that her marriage certificate
be burned and that all her wedding garments be taken
from her. He determined also that in the event of her death
no one should assume mourning, that her name should be inscribed
in no ancestral temple, and that she should be shut
up in her own apartments and strictly guarded.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now there appeared in the northwest a cloud which
was destined to overspread the whole of Korea, and China as
well. Norach‘i was chief of the Manchu tribes. He was from
the wild tribe of Kön-ju which, as we have seen, was broken
up by a Korean military expedition. His grandfather’s name
was Kyu-sang and his father’s name was Hapsiri. These had
both been put to death by a Chinese general, A-t‘ă, and to the
unquenchable hatred caused by this must be ascribed the terrible
reprisals the young Norach‘i made on China, where his
descendants occupy the imperial throne to this day. At the
time of his father’s death he had fled eastward beyond the
reach of China’s arm but gradually gaining power he crept
slowly westward again until he had a footing on the great
Manchu plains. But he was not yet ready to carry out his
plans against China, and when the Mongol, Hapuigeukosip,
entered the great wall and overthrew the Chinese general Yu
Pu, Norach‘i caught him and sent his head to Nanking. The
Emperor was pleased at this and gave him the rank of “Dragon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Tiger General.” Having thus disarmed suspicion, the
hardy northman began gathering and training troops until
there stood about him 10,000 skillful archers. Some years
before this he had killed his younger brother for fear of complications
and now in the year of the events of which we are
writing he had overcome the three great Chinese generals Yi
Yong-bang, Chang Seung-yun and Yang Yö-gwi. The ruling
dynasty of the Ming in China became well aware of the
gravity of the situation and saw that it was necessary to square
themselves for a desperate fight with the great Manchu <a id='corr64.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='leader'>leader.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_64.10'>leader.</a></span>
The first act of the Emperor was to send a summons to
the King of Korea ordering him to send generals and troops
at once to join the Chinese forces against Norach‘i. The king
responded by sending a man to find out the exact state of affairs,
whether China was weak or strong and whether it
would pay to help her in the coming struggle. This was paying
China back in kind for her delay in sending aid when the
Japanese invaded the peninsula, but Korea was thoroughly
loyal to the Ming power. She may be criticised in many ways
but there was never shown a deeper loyalty or devotion than
Korea showed the Mings during the years of struggle against
the Manchus, a devotion that always worked against her own
selfish interests.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chinese general Yang Ho sent back to the king and
said, “When we ask for aid do you merely send a spy to find
out how matters stand? This war is as much in your interests as
ours, so you had best send an army at once to form a junction
with us in Liao-tung.” However little stomach the king had
for the war this appeal was too strong to be set aside. Even
this base king could not overlook the tremendous obligation
under which Korea lay on account of aid rendered by China
against the Japanese. He therefore appointed generals Kang
Hong-rip and Kim Kyöng-sŭ as first and second in command
and under them three other generals, Chŭng Ho-sŭ, Yi Chung-nam
and Chŭng Eung-jŭng. These men were put in command
of 20,000 troops drawn from the five provinces of
P‘yŭng-an, Ham-gyŭng, Kyŭng-keui, Ch‘ung-ch‘ŭng and Chul-la,
and they were ordered to the northern border. This was
toward the close of the year, but before its end the Chinese
sent a messenger to hurry forward the Korean troops, as it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>was intended to make a grand demonstration with the opening
of the new year.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the first month of 1619 the troops went forward to the
seat of war. It was in the middle of winter and most of the
soldiers were going from a comparatively warm climate into
the rigors of a semi-arctic region. The Chinese Gen. Yang
Ho was advancing upon the Manchu position by four different
roads. The whole army rendezvoused at Sim-ha in Liao-tung
not far from the Korean border town of Eui-ju. The combined
forces were led by four generals, Yang Ho, Yu Chŭng,
Kyo Il-geui and the Korean Kang Hong-rip. Meeting a smallÖö
body of five hundred Manchu troops they drove them back into
the hills with considerable slaughter, and fondly supposed
that all the Manchus could be put to flight as easily. In this
preliminary skirmish the Koreans took a leading part, and one
general was killed and another was wounded in the hand.
The next day the whole force advanced to a place called Pu-go.
The right and left flanks of the army were composed of
Chinese and the center was held by Gen. Kang Hong-rip with
his Korean troops. Suddenly, almost without warning, ten
thousand Manchu horsemen swept down upon the right flank.
The impetuosity of the charge carried everything before it,
and almost instantly the whole right wing was thrown into
confusion and took to precipitate flight, in which both Gen.
Yu Chŭng and Gen. Yang Ho were killed. Then the Manchu
chief Kwi Yŭng-ga with 30,000 men came across the Ka-hap
Pass and fell upon the left flank, and that too was routed in
short order. The center under Gen. Kang had not yet been
attacked and stood unmoved by, and not unlikely unconscious
of, the terrible destruction being meted out to their allies to the
right and left. Now, Gen. Kang had been instructed by the
king to watch the turn of events and if the Chinese could not
hold their own to go over to the Manchus and make friends
with them. This indeed does not look much like loyalty to
China, but it must be remembered that we are dealing now
not with the Korean sentiment as a whole but with the wretch
who occupied the throne at the moment, and who had no
more real loyalty toward China than he had love for his own
country.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gen. Kang followed his instructions and sent to the Manchu
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>leader and said, “We are not enemies. There is no cause
for hostilities between us. We have been forced into this unpleasant
position against our wills. As the Chinese showed
us favors during the Japanese invasion we have had to make
some show of interest in order to reciprocate the favor, but as
things have turned out we should be glad to make friends
with you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Manchu chieftain was willing enough to come to this
agreement and so the whole Korean contingent went over <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
masse</span></em> to the Manchus. Gen. Yang was brought before Norach‘i
to make his obeisance. That powerful man was seated
upon a throne, clothed in yellow silk, and on either side were
many young women with jewelled pendants in their ears.
Gen. Kang was told to stand some distance away and bow,
but he said that in his own country his rank was sufficiently
high to warrant a nearer approach. So he was led nearer.
He then made only a slight genuflection. This did not please
the choleric Norach‘i and the general was compelled to make
a proper obeisance. Gen. Kim Kyöng-sŭ likewise went through
this humiliating ceremony.</p>

<p class='c000'>It appears that Gen. Kang had decided that it was to his
interests to join himself permanently to the Manchus, for
when soon after this Gen. Kim tried to despatch a letter to
the king, giving a carefully detailed account of the Manchus
and their strength, the letter was intercepted by Gen. Kang
who gave it to Norach‘i and advised that Gen. Kim be killed.
This was immediately done.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three months later the Manchu chief sent a letter to the
Korean king, couched in the following terms, “I have seven
causes for hating the Ming dynasty and it is impossible for
me to keep my hands off them. Now you and I are not
enemies. To be sure you have injured us more or less in the
past, but we will waive all that. It will be <a id='corr60.33'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='nceessary'>necessary</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_60.33'>necessary</a></span> for
you however to break off all connection with China and stop
aiding her in any way.” Gen. Kang also wrote at the same
time saying, “The Manchus are training all their youth to
war, and soon they will have the whole of Liao-tung.”
When the king received these letters he referred them to the
governor of P’yŭng-an Province to answer. The answer ran
as follows, “For two hundred years both you and we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>been the subjects of the Ming power and now that trouble
has arisen between you and the authorities at Nanking it will
be bad for you and us as well. China is like a parent to us
and how can we refuse to aid her? We cannot listen to your
demand and abstain from helping her. If you will make
peace with us and clearly define our boundaries and abstain
from conquest, China will not be only glad but will reward us
both with gifts.” To this the Manchu replied, “If you think
that China will give presents you have been grievously deceived
by her. They are all liars and cheats and I hate them.
Put away this idea and stand shoulder to shoulder with us.
We must take an oath and sacrifice a white horse to heaven
and a black bullock to the earth. After that I will send back
all your generals and soldiers. Let there be no more weapons
used between us, but only horse-whips.” This latter refers
to friendly intercourse by means of horses. Gen. Kang also
wrote, “Norach’i has <a id='corr67.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='takan'>taken</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_67.16'>taken</a></span> Puk-kwan and Gen. Kim T’ă-sŭk
is dead. Păk Yang-go has surrendered. Norach’i has
joined the Mongol forces to his own and is advancing on Yo-gwang.
His two sons Mangoda and Hongtasi advise him to
first seize Liao-tung. Every day there are long debates to discuss
whether it were better to strike Liao-tung or Korea first.
This is a secret but I am sure of what I say. They are making
great numbers of ladders and I am sure they are <a id='corr67.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='intendind'>intending</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_67.22'>intending</a></span>
to invade Korea first.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This letter troubled the King, for it interfered with his
own personal comfort. So he sent a swift messenger to
Nanking begging the Emperor to send a large force to “guard
your eastern territory” which meant that the king wanted
China to stand between him and this Manchurian scourge.</p>

<p class='c000'>The relatives of Gen. Kang were kept informed by him
of the state of affairs in the north, and they sent large sums
of money to Norach’i to buy him off and prevent him from invading
Korea; and it may be that it was this, at least in part,
that delayed it for some time. The king’s messengers found
the road to Nanking blocked by the Manchus and so had to
turn back. The king thereupon sent envoys one after another
by boat, but as the Koreans were poor sailors, they failed
to land at the right place and fell into the hands of the
Manchus or were wrecked by storms.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>The Manchus now, in 1621, held the whole of Liao-tung
and the Chinese residents were fleeing in all directions.
Thousands of them crossed into Korea and many crossed over
to the islands of Ok-kang and In-san near the mouth of the
Yalu River and there, huddled together in wretchedness and
want, bewailed their pitiable condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>The prefect of Eui-ju implored the king to forward troops
to hold the Manchus in check and the Chinese Gen. Wang
wrote the king demanding a contingent of Korean troops to
oppose the wild horde that threatened the Ming power. But
the king was utterly incompetent, and all Seoul was in a ferment.
The king thought only of himself, and looked to it
that a comfortable place was arranged for him on the island
of Kang-wha, in case it should become necessary for him to
leave Seoul. In the early summer a Korean named Yi Yöng-bang,
who had gone over to the Manchus body and soul, and
had become son-in-law to Norach’i, took a body of Manchu
cavalry, crossed over to the islands of Ok-kang and In-san
and massacred all the Chinese refugees he could lay hands on.
This again struck terror to the heart of the king, and it threw
Seoul into a fever of excitement. The king collected nine
thousand troops from the southern provinces and stationed
them at Su-wŭn, but there was no one whom he could appoint
general-in-chief; so he had to recall from banishment Han
Chun-gyŭm and confer this honor upon him. Han Myŭng-yŭn
was made second in command. He was a man of low extraction
but had acquired a certain amount of fame in the Japanese
invasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the following year, 1622, the Manchus entered China
and were everywhere victorious. They wanted to make a
treaty with Korea, but the king could decide neither one way
nor the other. His envoys had not reached China and he had
no word from the Emperor. The queen memorialized the king
in the native script and said, “Those northern savages want
to make peace with us, not because of any feeling of friendship
for us but because they think they cannot handle China
and Korea both at once. So they do this to keep us quiet until
they finish with China. The king should make up his mind
one way or the other and act. Think of what the Chinese
did for us during the late invasion! We were on the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>edge of destruction and they succored us. Both king and
people should be of one mind and hasten to send soldiers to
oppose this common enemy. Even if we do not succeed we
shall have clear consciences, for we shall know that we have
done what we could to aid China in the hour of her distress.”
In the third moon a letter arrived from the Manchu headquarters
which read as follows, “You say that you are the child
and China is the parent. Well, I am now striking your parent,
but you seem not to be able to help her. There is no use in
trying to do so.” In answer to this grim pleasantry the
craven king sent an envoy with gifts to the Manchu camp,
but the gifts and envoy were both spurned with insults.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chinese general Mo Mun-nyŭng fled from Liao-tung
by boat and landed at Yong-ch’ŭn in Korea. Finding there
many Chinese fugitives, and among them not a few soldiers,
he organized a little army and marched against the Manchus.
In his first fight he was quite successful, coming from the
field with the head of the Manchu general, T’ung Yang-jöng.
He then made his headquarters at Ch’ŭl-san. With the approach
of winter the Manchus crossed the Ya-lu in force and
he was outnumbered and had to flee. He sent a letter to the
king saying, “I am now here in your territory with a small
force, let us unite and drive back this Manchu <a id='corr69.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='horde.'>horde.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_69.24'>horde.”</a></span> But
nothing came of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Manchus were exceedingly cruel toward their captives.
Having collected a large number they made them sit
down in rows and then the Manchu braves went along the
line and shot arrows into their victims. If the wound was
not instantly mortal the victim was compelled to pluck out
the arrow with his own hands and give it back to his executioner.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile Korea was going from bad to worse. For
many years all official positions had been sold to the highest
bidder. Governors and generals paid 30,000 cash, prefects
20,000 and clerks paid 3,000. No office could be procured
without an immediate cash payment. The price put upon the
office of Prime Minister was so great that for many years no
one could afford to take it, and so the place remained vacant,
perhaps to the benefit of the people. The king was ruled by
a favorite concubine and she made use of her power to enrich
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>her relatives and those attached to her. She and other concubines
sent men to the country to peddle offices. Half the
money they kept themselves and the other half went to the
pockets of the concubines. Such was the desperate condition
of affairs when the year 1622 came in; and we must now record
the downfall of this <a id='corr70.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='wretehed'>wretched</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_70.6'>wretched</a></span> parody of a king.</p>

<p class='c000'>A man by the name of Yi Kwi had desired for a long time
to find some way of ridding the land of the desperate tyrant,
and at last he found five men who were willing to engage with
him in the good cause. They were Sim Kyöng-jin, Sim Keui-wŭn,
Kim Cha-jŭm, Ch‘oe Myŭng-gil, Kim Nyu. After thinking
the matter over and discussing it, they decided that if
their plan succeeded they would put on the throne the grandson
of Sŭn-jo Tă-wang. Kim Nyu was made the leader in
this plot. Collecting money they fitted out a small but select
body of soldiers and put Gen. Yi Heung-ip at their head, and
the day for the event was set. But one of the men connected
with the plot turned traitor and told the king the whole plan.
The conspirators learned of it immediately and decided to carry
out their program in spite of all. As it happened, the king
was in a drunken carouse at the time this interesting bit of
information was given him and he forgot all about it. That
very night the band of conspirators met at the appointed rendezvous
beyond the Peking Pass. But there was trouble,
because some soldiers who were expected from Chang-dan had
not yet arrived; so a swift messenger was sent to find them.
They were met twenty <em>li</em> out and hurried forward. Yi Kwal,
with several other generals, went to meet these troops beyond
the pass and lead them into the city. They found several
hundred soldiers ready for the enterprise; but a man named
Chang Yu came in haste from the city and said, “The king has
been told. The government troops are coming out to seize
us.” Yi Kwi seized Yi Kwal by the hand and said, “Kim Nyu
who was to lead us has not arrived and you must be our
leader.” So he consented. He gave each soldier a piece of
paper to fasten to the back of his collar so that they would be
able to recognize each other and not be thrown into confusion.
At the last moment Kim Nyu arrived and then there
was a quarrel between him and Yi Kwal as to the leadership;
but as day was about to dawn they let Kim Nyu take charge.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Having heard that the government troops were coming out
of the West Gate they hastened around the mountain and entered
the Northwest Gate. When the government troops learned
by the great noise and tumult in the city that they had
been outwitted, they returned only to find the insurrectionary
troops before the palace. They had cut their way through
the gates with axes and were setting fire to everything inside.
As they entered the king’s apartments he slipped out the back
door and scaling the back wall found refuge in a monk’s room.
From that place he made his way to the house of one An Kuk-sin
where he secured a suit of mourner’s clothes and then went
to the house of a physician, Chöng Nam-su. This man however
informed the new government as to his whereabouts and
he was seized. This occurred in the year 1622.</p>

<p class='c000'>Prince Neung-yang, the nephew of the deposed king, was
elevated to the royal position and crowds of people came and
bowed to him as he sat in state before the palace. His posthumous
title is In-jo Tă-wang.</p>

<p class='c000'>His first act was to send a chair to bring back the queen
dowager, from the Myŭng-ye Palace; but she, thinking that it
might perhaps be a trick on the part of the wicked king, refused
to go. She said, “The king himself must come and take
me out.” So he came and showed her that the good news
was indeed true. She sat on the throne just as she had done
in the days of King Sŭn-jo, and when the new king came in he
prostrated himself before her and wept; but she said, “Do not
weep; this is a day of deliverance, and you should rather rejoice.”
Then they brought in the depraved and fallen creature
who had tried to play at king but had made a lamentable
failure. The queen dowager exclaimed, “This arch-traitor
and bloody man has come, and he must be judged here and now
or I cannot leave this place. For ten years I have been imprisoned
here. Day before yesterday I dreamed that the aged
king Sŭn-jo came and said, ‘In a few days you will be delivered.’”
The eunuchs brought the royal seals and the insignia
of royalty and gave them to the newly appointed king. He
banished the deposed king to Kang-wha and his son to Kyo-dong
Island. He then gave posthumous honors to Princes
Im-hă, Neung-chang, Yŭn-heung, Pu-wön and Yöng-ch‘ang
whom the tyrant had caused to be murdered. He also called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>the queen dowager’s mother from exile on the island of Quelpart.</p>

<p class='c000'>He found the government in a profoundly wretched condition
and he forthwith began a systematic house-cleaning.
He appointed new ministers to the six departments and a proclamation
was sent to the eight provinces saying that every
prefect who had bought his place should be driven from office
and that all the land that had been stolen from the people
should be returned to them; also that every prefectural clerk
should pay up the arrears of revenue which he had withheld
from the government. He drew up a company of soldiers at
Chong-no, the center of the city, and there executed the
former favorite Yi I-ch‘ŭm and seventeen other men who had
aided and abetted the deposed king in his monstrosities. Sixty
more were banished to distant places where they were confined
in small enclosures surrounded with brier hedges, and their
food was handed them through small holes in the hedges.
Pang Yŭp, the governor of P‘yŭng-an Province, and two
others in the country, were executed by special messengers
sent down to the country for the purpose. This Pang Yŭp
was a most desperate villain. As he had something of a body-guard,
resistance was anticipated, but the special messenger
of death managed to draw off the guard on some pretext or
other and then the work was done swiftly and surely. This
governor was so detested by the people that they cut his body
into small pieces and each man carried away a small piece “to
remember him by.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The king made Yi Kwi General-in-chief, conferred
upon his father the title of Prince Chong-wŭn and upon
his mother that of Pu-pu-in and gave her a palace to live in
where the government hospital now stands. He drove out
from the palace all vile women, all musical instruments, and
he burned at Chong-no the wooden semblance of a mountain
which the former king had caused to be made and which
was always carried in his procession. This “mountain” was
covered with growing shrubs and flowering plants. He
made Gen. Chang Man commander of all the provincial forces,
with his <a id='corr72.36'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='headquaters'>headquarters</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_72.36'>headquarters</a></span> at P’yŭng-yang. He beheaded the
brother of the deposed queen and also the prefect who had
suffocated the young prince at Kang-wha. Spies were sent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>throughout the country to ascertain the actual state of affairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>This king was a deadly enemy of Buddhism, and he it
was who ordered that no monk should set foot inside the
gates of Seoul. The law was promulgated that whenever a
common person entered the gates of Seoul he must dismount
from his horse. Sacrifices were offered by the king in person
at the tomb of Ki-ja and at the blood-marked stone at Song-do,
the spot where Chöng Mong-ju had been murdered when
the dynasty was founded. It was decreed that revenue
should be collected to the extent of a tithe of the grain, which
was much less than before, but was collected more regularly.
We cannot but sympathize with the wife of the son
of the deposed king, who had been banished to Kyo-dong
Island. She followed him into exile and attempted to secure
his escape by digging with her own tender hands a tunnel
seventy feet long. She had no other implement than a piece
of iron resembling a common fire-poker. At the very moment
of his escape the plot was discovered and the poor wife hanged
herself out of grief and disappointment. When the king heard
of this he ordered that honorable burial be given her remains
and he put the young man out of misery by administering
poison. That same year the deposed queen died and the
king gave her the burial honors of a princess. She had been
a devoted Buddhist and had endowed many monasteries with
wooden or clay images. But she was not happy as queen
and prayed that when, according to the Buddhist doctrine,
she should take on another life it might not be that of a
queen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The story of Yi Kwal’s rebellion shows how great a matter
a little fire kindles. The king wished to honor in a special
manner the men who had been instrumental in putting
him on the throne. Among them were two especially deserving
men, Kim Nyu and Yi Kwal. Kim was from a higher
family than Yi but was less deserving of praise in this affair.
When all knelt before the king and Yi Kwal found that he
was given second place, he was enraged and refused to kneel,
but stood glaring about him. He was pacified, but was still
very sore at heart. He was given the position of governor
of P’yŭng-an where there was a considerable force of soldiers;
among them three hundred Japanese, who had become naturalized
and who where excellent swordsmen. With the
opening of the new year Gen. Yi Kwi, who knew the calibre
of Yi Kwal, obtained the post of military instructor at Song-do.
This he sought that he might have an opportunity to
stand between the king and any treachery that Yi Kwal
might attempt. A courtier, Mun Whe, told the king that Yi
Kwal was gathering an army with bad intent, and the king
hastily called a council. Kim Nyu did not believe it possible
that Yi Kwal should revolt, but Ch’oe Myŭng-gil insisted
that it was true, and in the high words that followed Kim
Nyu was charged with being privy to the plot. But the remark
passed unnoticed. We shall see however that Kim
had little to do in putting down the insurrection. Perhaps
it was because of a lurking suspicion that he might be implicated.
A large number of men known to be intimate with
the disaffected general were arrested and thrown into prison.
Two executioners were sent to kill Han Myŭng-yŭn who was
said to be in league with Yi Kwal, and to catch Yi Kwal’s
son. Arriving in P’yŭng-yang the messengers went boldly
into the presence of Yi Kwal and announced their message.
As Yi was already on the point of marching on Seoul he
answered by taking off the heads of the messengers. Hastily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>summoning all the neighboring prefects he addressed them as
follows: “The king is surrounded by bad men and I propose
to go up to Seoul and clean things out a little.” Then putting
in motion his 20,000 troops with the Japanese swordsmen
at their head, he marched toward the capital. The whole
country instantly burst into a flame of excitement. The
king appointed Gen. Yi Wŭn-ik to lead an army in defense
of the capital, and he put Yi Si-bal second in command. Yi
Su-il became general of P’yŭng-an Province, and the combined
forces marched northward to block the rebel’s path. Gen.
Wan P’ung-gun fortified Song-do in preparation for an attack.
O Yong-su fortified the banks of the Im-jin River at
the ferry. The eight provinces were all requisitioned for
troops. Kang Kak was placed at Su-an with militia from
Su-an and Sö-heung to check the advance of the enemy.
Gen. Chöng Ch’ung-sin who had been stationed at An-ju
north of P’yŭng-yang, together with other leaders, moved
southward on the rebellious city, to take Yi Kwal in the rear.
Chang Man asked him what he thought were the chances of
Yi Kwal’s success, and he answered, “If Yi Kwal goes
straight to Seoul and the king stays there till he arrives the
result will be doubtful, but if he delays a while in Whang-hă
Province, or if the king retreats southward and Yi Kwal delays
in Seoul we will kill him like a dog.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gen. Chang Man then called about him all the forces
within reach, led by fifteen captains and prefects. When he
saw how small his army was compared with that of Yi Kwal
he despaired of doing anything, but some-one said, “Many of
those under Yi Kwal are not faithful to him. Let us send
and call out the loyal ones from among his army.” So they
sent a slave of Gen. Yi Yun-sŭ, who followed Yi Kwal, and
told him to go and bring his master out of the rebel ranks.
They offered him a hundred thousand cash but he refused it
saying “I will go and save him from rebellion if I can, and
if I succeed it will be time enough to reward me.” The slave
entered the rebel ranks and that night the sentries heard the
voice of Gen. Yi Yun-sŭ calling aloud from outside the lines
saying, “I am going over to the side of the king.” Arriving
at the camp of Chang Man, the penitent general burst into
tears at the thought of how near he had come to being a traitor.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Yi Kwal sent eight assassins to kill Chang Man but they
were caught and brought before their intended victim, who,
instead of punishing them, gave them a good dinner and sent
them away. Yi Kwal himself was so fearful of assassination
that he not only slept in a different tent each night but moved
from one tent to another several times during a single night.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gen. Chang Man started for Seoul, the advance guard
being led by Chöng-sin, the skirmish line by Pak Yöng-sŭ, the
right and left flanks by Yu Hyo-gŭl and Chang Tŭn, the sappers
by Ch’o‘e, while the commissariat was in charge
of An Mong-yun. The whole force consisted of 1800 men.
The first day was spent in getting the army across the Ta-dong
River. The next three days brought them to Whang-ju,
where they fell in with part of the rebel army. After a
brisk skirmish, two companies of cavalry were seen riding out
from the <a id='corr76.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='robel'>rebel</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_76.16'>rebel</a></span> ranks as if to surrender, but when they had
come close to Gen. Chang Man’s forces they made a sudden
charge which threw the loyal forces into confusion and soon
the entire army was routed. Turning from this complete
victory, Yi Kwal led his forces to Su-an. It was his intention
to approach Seoul by way of Sak-wŭn but as the government
had a strong force there he changed his plan and came by
Keui-rin which is an exceedingly rough road. Meanwhile Gen.
Chang Man had collected the scattered remnants of his army
and followed as far Sö-heung where he was joined by Gen.
Yi Su-il and together they proceeded southward to P‘yŭng-san.
There they were joined by 800 more troops. On the
sixth of the moon Yi Kwal arrived at the Cho-t‘an ford and
found it guarded by a royal force under Yi Chung-ho and Yi
Tŭk-bu. Yi Kwal forced the passage and put the government
troops to flight, taking the heads of both the generals. A day
or so later, being met by more loyal troops, he sent them the
two heads as warning. They did not heed it and in the fight
that followed their leaders too lost their heads.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile interesting events were happening in Seoul.
The king put to death forty-nine men who were suspected of
being privy to the plot, though many of them were doubtless
innocent. Yi Kwi begged him to spare some of them, but he
was obdurate. Gen. Yi Sö took 2,000 men and went to the
gate on the main road a few miles beyond Song-do and tried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>to hold it against the insurgent army. Yi Kwal attacked at
night and found little difficulty in breaking through the barrier.
But instead of advancing on Song-do he made a circuit
and thereby avoided both Song-do and the force which was
set to guard the passage of the Im-jin River. He effected a
crossing by a ford higher up that stream. Learning of this,
Pak Hyo-rip who was holding the ferry hastened back to
Seoul where he arrived at dusk and announced that the king
had not a moment to lose but must take to flight that very
night. Without an hour’s delay the king mounted his steed
and fled by way of the South Gate, leaving the city in a
perfect frenzy of fear. He arrived at Han-gang in the dark
and found that the ferrymen had taken all their boats to the
other side for safety. They peremptorily refused to obey any
summons, and at last U Sang-jung was obliged to throw off
his clothes and swim the stream. He succeeded in getting
six boats. It took all the rest of the night to get the royal
cavalcade across the river. It was on the ninth of the moon
when the king arrived at Sa-p‘yŭng just beyond the river.
He had nothing to eat till noon that day, when Sin Chun
brought him a bowl of gruel and a few dried persimmons.
Night found him at Su-wŭn completely tired out. After a rest
of a few days he passed on to Kong-ju the provincial capital
and there he was made comfortable for the first time since his
flight from the capital. The governors of Ch‘ung ch‘ŭng and
Chŭl-la Provinces met him there. A strong guard was placed
along the southern bank of the Keum River.</p>

<p class='c000'>At noon of the day following the king’s flight, thirty followers
of Yi Kwal entered the city and announced that there
was no need for fear, as a new king had arisen. The next
day Yi Kwal entered the town. Many small officials and a
great crowd of people went out to meet him and scattered red
earth along the road in front of him, which is a special prerogative
of royalty. Entering the city he pitched his camp
where the Kyöng-bok Palace now stands. Even the king’s
own uncle went over to Yi Kwal, perhaps through fear, or
perhaps because the revolution was a success. This uncle
was proclaimed king and posters were sent out to quiet the
people. Thousands of adventurers and low fellows sought
and obtained official appointments under the new regime.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>But what had been going on in the north? Chang Man,
arriving at P‘a-ju, learned that the king had fled, and immediately
called a council of war. It was decided that, as the
people of Seoul were not largely in favor of Yi Kwal, it would
be a good thing to make a demonstration at once lest the
people should come to recognize the government. So one
body of troops was sent to watch the road outside the East Gate
and to cut off supplies. Another guarded the roads outside
the South Gate. Gen. Chöng Ch‘ung-sin said that they must
encamp on the hills immediately outside the West Gate and
then Yi Kwal would be forced to fight. In order to do this
Kim Yang-ön took cavalry and surprised the signal fire station
beside the Peking Pass and so prevented any signal being
given. That night Chang Man and all his forces came around
the hills and stationed themselves behind the hill just back of
Mo-wha-gwan. This movement was further favored by a
strong east wind that carried the sound away so that all Seoul
was ignorant of the extreme proximity of the enemy. At the
same time Yi Whak with two hundred troops secreted himself
outside the Northwest Gate, to enter the city when the
insurgent troops should go out the West Gate to attack Chang
Man’s forces. The latter also sent thousands of slips of paper
into the city and had them distributed among the people saying,
“Tomorrow, anyone who refuses to stand by Yi Kwal
and remains loyal to the king, let him present one of these
slips and he <a id='corr78.25'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='small'>shall</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_78.25'>shall</a></span> receive a reward.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the morning Yi Kwal spied a small band of soldiers
on the hill outside the gate, for most of the force was concealed
behind it, in order to deceive the rebels. Some of Yi
Kwal’s followers said, “They are so few we had better go outside
the Northwest Gate and so surround them; but the
enemy seemed so insignificant that Yi Kwal marched straight
at them. All Seoul was on the walls watching the fight with
breathless interest. Han Myŭng-yŭn, Yi Kwal’s right hand
man, took the Japanese contingent and moved up the steep
hillside, and Yi followed with the main body. The strong
east wind that was blowing materially aided the attacking
force, for it lent speed to their arrows and they had the wind
at their backs instead of in their faces. The loyal forces were
forced to give way a little and their leaders had to <a id='corr78.39'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='stike'>strike</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_78.39'>strike</a></span> down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>some in order to prevent a general stampede. At this critical
juncture the wind suddenly veered to the west and drove
the sand and dust into the eyes of the attacking party. This
was the turning point in the battle. Yi Kwal was forced to
give ground. Han Myŭng-yŭn himself was wounded by an arrow.
Gen. Chang Man fought fiercely for two hours, gaining
ground all the time. At this time the standard-bearer of
Yi Kwal turned and fled. The cry arose, “Yi Kwal is on
the run,” and in less that a minute the whole force was thrown
into confusion and every man took to his heels, including Yi
Kwal himself, who hastened back toward the West Gate.
But the citizens on the wall had not been idle, and he found
the gate locked and barred. Turning aside he hastened
along under the wall till he reached the South Gate which he
entered. Gen. Chang Man said, “Let us not chase him, for
his men might turn on us and beat us after all. Let him go;
the people will bring his head in soon enough.” So Yi Kwal
with a small band of followers fled out the Water Mouth Gate,
crossed the Han at Song-p‘a, killed the prefect of Kwang-ju,
scaled Yi-bu-jă Pass and fled away eastward. Gen. Chöng
Ch‘ung-sin chased him as far as Kyöng-an. By that time the
traitor’s band had dwindled to twenty-eight men. He fled by
night as far as Muk-pangi in the prefecture of I-ch‘ŭn and
there two of his followers, seeing that the game had been
played to a finish and hoping to save their own lives, went
into his room by night and severed his head from the body.
His son was treated in the same way, as were also Han
Myŭng-yŭn and six others. They carried the heads to Kongju
and laid them before the king. The king’s uncle who
had been set up as king fled to Kwang-ju, where he was
caught and turned over to Gen. Chang Man, who imprisoned
him and waited the orders of the king. But another man,
Sim Keui-wŭn, said, “No, he is a traitor,” and slew him with
his own hand. When the king returned to Seoul this man
Sim was imprisoned for a few days as nominal punishment
for having killed a relative of the king.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the twenty-second of the month the king returned to
Seoul. Gen. Chang Man went to the river and escorted
him in with a large retinue, but Gen. Chöng Ch‘ung-sin did
not go and bow before the king, for he said, “I did not stop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>the traitor, but let him drive the king from the capital.” So
he went up to P’yŭng-yang without seeing the king. When
the latter heard of this he sent for him and gave him a present
of gold and made him governor of P‘yŭng-an. It is said
by some, in extenuation of Yi Kwal’s conduct, that he understood
that the king had driven the former king from the
throne and was a usurper. This must be false, for Yi Kwal
was one of the principal actors in those events and must have
known the truth about them. He was simply jealous and,
having a strong force, thought to avenge himself. However
that may be, the report was spread that it was patriotism that
prompted the revolt, and to dispel any such idea the king
made proclamation saying, “Kwang-hă, the former ruler, was
a wicked and undutiful man. He killed his father and elder
brother and imprisoned his mother. The country was on the
verge of destruction and so I could not but attempt to drive
him out. It was not because I wanted to usurp the royal
honors, but it was for the sake of the line. Yi Kwal’s raid
was prompted by idle rumors gotten up by certain of Kwang-hă’s
men, but let all the people know surely that I have done
this for the sole purpose of saving the kingdom.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the ninth moon another revolt was attempted, with
the object of putting Prince In-sŭng, the king’s younger
brother, on the throne. It was discovered in time and the
principal movers were killed and the prince was banished to
Kan-sŭng in Kang-wŭn Province.</p>

<p class='c000'>On account of the frequent conflagrations in the city of
P’yŭng-yang, the governor petitioned the king to promulgate
a law requiring all houses in that town to be tiled instead of
thatched. The king not only complied but gave money for
the purchase of tiles. That law has not been abrogated to
this day.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><em>THE SHIP-YARD.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The year 1625 opened with warlike preparations. Gen.
Yi Sö collected a band of strong, stalwart men, the pick of
the land, formed them into companies and regiments and drilled
them at the Hun-yŭn-wŭn, inside the East Gate, and also
at Mo-wha-kwan outside the West Gate. Near the close
of the year the king promulgated a most important law,
sweeping away the disabilities of sons by concubines and giving
them the right to become officials. One must know the prevalence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>of concubinage in Korea in order to understand how
vitally this law must have affected the whole body of the people,
of all ranks and classes. This was the more true from
the fact that concubines are commonly taken because of the
lack of an heir. Eligibility to office on the part of sons of
of concubines worked therefore in two directions. It elevated
the position of the concubine and at the same time made the
position of the barren wife more endurable.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have already given a sketch of the beginnings of the
Manchu convulsion which was about to shake the whole of
eastern Asia. During the interval occupied by the events
narrated above, the Manchus were quietly preparing for the
future. Gen. Kang Hong-rip, the Korean renegade, was
still with them. Another Korean went over to the Manchus.
It was Han Yun who fled to Kwi-sŭng in northern P‘yŭng-an,
from which place he crossed the Ya-lu and found Gen.
Kang among the Manchus. To him he said, “My relatives
have now all been destroyed by the king and I am an outcast.
Let us get an army together and go and be avenged on the
Koreans.” Gen. Kang gave his hearty consent and together
they sought the throne of the Manchu chief to lay their plan
before him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sŏ U-sin, the Ming governor of Liao-tung, heard of this
plan and despatched a messenger to the King of Korea setting
him on his guard against these two men. The king did
not believe that Gen. Kang was irrecoverably lost, for he appointed
his son to go to the Manchus as envoy. Had this
young man succeeded in reaching his destination he might
have induced his father to remain faithful to Korea, but just
beyond the border he encountered Manchu soldiers who did
not understand him and would not let him pass. So he was
compelled to return with his mission unaccomplished. It is
probable that there would have been an invasion of Korea by
the Manchus at that time had it not been for the arrival in
Liao-tung of the great Chinese general Wŭn Sung-whan.
He was so skillful in the handling of soldiers that superhuman
powers were ascribed to him. The Manchus could make
no headway against him, and it is said that Norach’i’s
chagrin at having failed to storm a town held by this famous
general aggravated an illness caused by a carbuncle on his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>back and brought about his death. Upon his decease his
second son Hongt’asi took the reins of government and carried
to completion the ambitious plans made by his illustrious
father.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is apparent that the Korean court was well awake to
the dangers confronting them, for we learn that in the seventh
moon of this year 1626 the wall of Nam-han was completed.
This is the great mountain fortress about twenty
miles to the south-east of Seoul. It was formerly the site
of one of the capitals of Păkje.</p>

<p class='c000'>The year 1627 no sooner opened that the long dreaded
event took place. On the fifth moon 30,000 Manchu soldiers
crossed the Yalu River and a few days later stood before
the city of Eui-ju. Approaching the gate a herald cried,
“The second king of the great Golden Kingdom is now laying
his heavy hand on Korea. If you do not come out and surrender
we will raze your town to the level of the ground.”
Unfortunately for the good name of Korea the <a id='corr82.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='perfect'>prefect</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_82.18'>prefect</a></span> was at
that moment sleeping off the effects of a drunken debauch in
the house of a dancing girl. He came forth and tried to get
the garrison together, but it was too late, for already the
traitor Han Yun had entered the town in Korean clothes and
had thrown the gates open to the ruthless invaders. The
prefect and his whole garrison were set up in line and shot
down by the savage Manchus, after which they boiled the
body of the prefect in a kettle and sacrificed to heaven with
the flesh. They then sent a letter to the king couched in the
following terms: “You have committed four crimes. (1) You
did not send an envoy to commiserate with us on the death
of the great Norach’i. (2) You have never thanked us for
sparing your army when we beat you and the Chinese together.
(3) You afforded asylum to our enemy, Mo Mun-nyŏng.
(4) Your people have killed many of the residents of
Liao-tung in cold blood. It is for these reasons that our
wrath is kindled against you.” And so the invading army
moved southward, forcing the Koreans to cut their hair and
compelling them to act as guides. But they did not come
unopposed. They were met at Yong-ch’ŭn by its prefect at
the head of 2,000 men, but a small official turned traitor and
opened the gates to the Manchus. On the seventeenth they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>arrived at Kwak-san where they were told by the Korean
garrison that death was preferable to surrender; the Koreans
found it so, for they were soon overpowered and massacred.
Two prefects whose wives had been confiscated by the <a id='corr83.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Mancus'>Manchus</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_83.3'>Manchus</a></span>
thought to save themselves and recover their wives by going
over to the enemy but when they did so they found their
wives still held as concubines while they themselves were
compelled to hold the bridles of the men who brutally refused
to give back the women.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seoul was meanwhile going through one of those periodical
eruptions which she was destined to suffer for many
years to come. Gen. Chang Man became general-in-chief, with
Chöng Ch’ung Sin as second They immediately took all the
available forces and marched northward. Gen. Sin was placed
at the Im-jin River to block the approach of the enemy
Gen. Kim went south to collect troops in Ch’ung-ch’ŭng
Province, and others went in other directions. A call was
made to all the eight provinces for men. Gen. Yi Sö was
put in command of Nam-han. The king recalled many men
from banishment, probably with a view to bringing into harmony
all the different elements and securing unanimity
among all classes.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the twenty-first the Manchus arrived before Au-ju.
They cried, “Come out and surrender,” and received the
answer, “We are here to fight and not to surrender.” The
next day at dawn in a heavy fog they approached the wall.
They had an enormous ladder mounted in some way on the
backs of camels. This was placed against the wall and the
enemy swarmed over, armed only with short swords and
knives; but these they used with such good effect that they
soon gained a foothold. The commandant of the town, Nam
Yi-heung, stood by the gate and shot many of the Manchus
with his good bow and when his arrows were all gone he
ordered bags of powder to be brought, and by exploding
these he killed many of the enemy but was himself killed in
the process.</p>

<p class='c000'>P’yŭng-yang now being practically without defense, the
prefect fled southward to the capital and told the king what
had happened. The Crown Prince was immediately sent into
the south for safety and the king himself with the ancestral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>tablets and with his court hastened to the island of Kang-wha,
leaving the city of Seoul in a condition better imagined than
described.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of Gen. Kang’s grievances against Korea was that
he thought the king had killed his son, but when he learned
that this was not only not true but that the king had sent
that son as envoy, though unsuccessfully, to the Manchus,
there was a strong revulsion of feeling in his mind and he expressed
his sorrow at the invasion but said that it was now too
late to stop it. He however advised the king to send gifts to
the Manchu chief and sue for peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Manchus arrived at Whang-ju they sent a letter
forward to the king on Kang-wha saying, “There are three
conditions on which we will conclude a peace with you. (1)
You must hand over to us the person of Mo Mun-nyŭng. (2)
You must give us 10,000 soldiers to help invade China. (3)
You must give up the two northern provinces of P’yŭng-an
and Ham-gyŭng.” On the ninth of the moon the envoy bearing
this letter, accompanied by the Korean renegade Gen.
Kang, took boat from Song-do for Kang-wha. The next day
the king gave them audience and the envoy bowed before
him, but the king did not bow in return. This made the envoy
very angry, but the king said through an interpreter, “Tell
him not to be angry, for I did not know the custom.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The king sent one Kang-In to Whang-ju ostensibly to
sue for peace but in reality to find out what the Manchus were
doing there. Not long after this the Manchu envoy returned
to the same place but Gen. Kang remained on Kang-wha.
When the enemy had advanced as far as P’yŭng-san, only a
hundred <em>li</em> from Kang-wha, the whole court urged the king to
make peace on any terms, as all the soldiers had run away
and the enemy were so near. When Gen. Kim, who had been
left to guard Seoul, learned of the proximity of the Manchus,
he fired all the government treasure and provisions and made
good his escape. This was the signal for a general exodus of
the people who swarmed out of the city and scattered in all
directions seeking safety among the mountains or in remote
provinces.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yun Hŭn had been imprisoned for having fled from
P’yŭng-yang without so much as attempting its defense, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>many of the officials begged the king to pardon him; but they
overdid it, and so many petitions came in that the king thought
he was dangerously popular and ordered his execution. When
the messenger of death reached the doomed man he found
him playing a game of chess. The man with whom he was
playing burst out crying, but he said, “What are you crying
about? I am the man who am going to die, not you. Let
us finish the game.” So they finished the game, after which
Yun Hŭn quietly submitted to his fate. This is a sample of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>sang froid</em></span> which never fails to elicit the applause of the Korean.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the twentieth the Manchu general Yu Hă left P’yŭng-san
and went to Kang-wha to have an audience with the king.
He advised the king to discard the Chinese calendar and use
the Manchu one instead and he also <a id='corr85.14'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='said said'>said</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_85.14'>said</a></span> the king must
send his son to the north as hostage. The king answered
that his son was too young, but that he would send his younger
brother. Accordingly he sent Wŭn Ch’ang-yŭng, not his
brother but a distant relative. At the same time he sent
30,000 pieces of cotton, 300 pieces of white linen, 100 tiger
skins and 100 leopard skins. Gen. Yu Hă was pleased at this
and said that he wished to have Korea at peace but that it
would first be absolutely necessary for the king to take a
solemn oath of fealty to the Manchus. And he said it must
be done immediately, before the Manchus should enter Seoul.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day a letter came from the Manchu Prince Yi
Wan urging that a treaty be made and the solemn oath be
sworn, and he added, “Either there must be such a treaty or
we must fight.” He ordered that the king have an altar made
at once, on which to slay the animals and swear the oath.
The Koreans hung back and said, “Have we not sent gifts and
hostages to the north? Why then should we be compelled to
take this oath?” In a rage the Manchu messenger rode away
toward P’yŭng-san. This sudden departure was ominous and
it frightened the Koreans, so that they hastened to set about
building the altar. When, therefore, a few days later the
Manchu generals Kang Hong-rip and Yu Hă came with an
escort and demanded that a treaty should be ratified at once,
the Koreans hastened to comply. The king went with Gen.
Yu Hă to the altar and the king was ordered to plunge the
knife into the victims, a white horse and a black bullock which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>signified the heavens and the earth respectively. At this the
courtiers all exclaimed, “The king cannot do it. It must be
done by deputy.” The king replied. “It makes no difference
now. We have eaten their insults and the people are all about
to perish. I will do it.” But still they opposed it so strongly
that at last Yi Chŭng-gwi was appointed as substitute for the
king.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was on the third day of the third moon of 1627 when
the ceremony was performed outside the West Gate of the fortress
of Kang-wha. They killed the white horse and black
bullock and sacrificed to heaven. The Manchu oath ran as follows:
“The second king of the Manchus makes a treaty with
the king of Korea. From this day we have but one mind and
one thought. If Korea breaks this oath may heaven send a
curse upon her. If the Manchus break it may they likewise be
punished. The two kings will have an equal regard for truth
and they will govern according to the principles of religion.
May heaven help us and give us blessings.” The Korean
oath was as follows: “This day Korea takes oath and forms a
treaty with the Keum (Kin) Kingdom. We too swear by this
sacrifice that each shall dwell secure in the possession of his
own lands. If either hates and injures the other may heaven
send punishment upon the offending party. These two kings
have minds regardful of truth. Each must be at peace with
the other.” The next day the three highest Korean officials
went to the Manchu camp to settle the details of the treaty.
They said, “As we have made a treaty with you, of course you
will not let your troops advance on Seoul. It will be best for
you to move backward at once. Now you are the ‘elder
brother’ and we the ‘younger brother,’ so you will see the
propriety of staying on the other side of the Yalu River. The
Ming dynasty of China has been as a parent to us for two
hundred years and our kings have always received investiture
from the Emperor. We have made a treaty now with you,
but that does not require us to cast off the suzerainty of
China.” This raised a storm about the Koreans’ ears, and
for days they disputed over the point with the Korean commission,
but could not move them a hair’s breadth from this position.
At last in astonishment Gen. Yu Hă sat down, folded
his hands and said “The Kingdom of Korea is like a small island
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>or like a hair, and if we should but raise our foot it would
be destroyed, and yet though destruction stares them in the
face they will not forswear their fealty to China. This is
greatness. Such righteousness and faithfulness are admirable.
If the Manchu king consents, you shall do as you please
in this respect.” They sent to the Manchu Prince who was
with the army at P‘yŭng-san and he gave his consent. Gen.
Yu Hă then put in the Manchu claim for yearly tribute. It
was an enormous amount but the Koreans decided they would
send at least a small part of what was demanded.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Manchu army then moved northward <a id='corr87.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='beyong'>beyond</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_87.11'>beyond</a></span> P’yŭng-yang
to An-ju, being opposed there by Gen. Chöng Ch‘ung-sin
they told him that they had made a treaty with Korea and
were on their way back to Manchuria. He thought they were
retreating and were trying to deceive him, so he said, “I have
received no intimation of all this from headquarters, so you
will have to wait here until I get word from the king.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Manchu army on its way north through Whang-hă
Province had stolen right and left, oxen, horses and women.
They bored holes through the hands of children and fastened
them together with cords and drove them north to make slaves
of them. In the province of P‘yŭng-an they did not commit
these outrages, for there was a large sprinkling of Manchus
among the people. When they left P’yŭng-yang they burned
it to the ground. North of that place they put a garrison in
every large town, namely An-ju, Chöng-ju, Sŭn-ch‘ŭn and
Eui-ju. Strangely enough Koreans were put at the head of
these garrisons. Of course these bodies of troops had to live
off the people, and it seems that they did not scruple to
plunder and confiscate in a wholesale manner. This is indicated
by the fact that Chöng Pang-su the prefect of Chŭn-san
got out of patience and said it could no longer be borne. So
gathering about him as many soldiers as possible, he began to
make war on the Manchu garrisons wherever encountered.
The Manchus were cut down by hundreds, as the country was
being scoured by small bands of foragers who fell into this
prefect’s hands. Three of the Manchu captains joined their
forces and tried to make headway against this Korean combination,
but they were all killed and their forces cut to
pieces. The king, when he heard of these actions, was loud
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>in praise of the Koreans who so successfully opposed the unlawful
acts of the Manchu garrisons.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not long after this a letter came from the Manchu headquarters
saying, “Having made a treaty of peace with us, why
do you now set upon and kill our people?” To which the
Koreans boldly replied. “It was one of the conditions of that
treaty that all Manchus should move beyond the Yalu. If
they had done so, there would have been no trouble. But
many of your people stopped in P‘yŭng-an Province and stole
our cattle and our women. The people could not endure it
and so revolted. But it was not at our instigation. It is
evident that the trouble began with you. It would be well if
you would send back the 2,000 people you have carried away
captive to Manchuria.” The argument was conclusive, as
the Manchus acknowledged by sending back the captive Koreans.
When the Japanese heard that the Koreans had been
successfully opposing the Manchus they sent a present of 300
muskets, 300 swords and 300 pounds of powder, but the Koreans
wisely declined the gifts and sent them back to Japan.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the tenth of the fourth moon the king started back
towards Seoul, which he entered two days later. He was now
fully awake to the need of a well drilled army, and he set to
work in earnest drilling one. He stationed a general at
Kang-wha permanently and instituted the custom of requiring
military duty of every citizen under forty years of age and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>over fifteen. Some were sent to Seoul to drill for three years.
The first year was spent in learning the methods of guarding
gates and walls, the second in musket practice, and the third
in swordsmanship and archery. When they had been <a id='corr89.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='thorroughly'>thoroughly</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_89.4'>thoroughly</a></span>
drilled they were sent to the country to drill the
militia. In this way an available force of 700,000 men is said
to have been trained. If this is the estimate of the number
of able-bodied men between fifteen and forty it gives a valuable
clue to the entire population of the country at the time.
At this time the custom was revived of having the men stand
in squads of ten, five in front and five behind. When the
front rank had discharged their pieces they fell back and the
rear line stepped forward and discharged theirs, while the
others reloaded. A Chinese envoy was sent from Nanking
with a message to the king but refused to come further than
Ka-do Island, from which place he forwarded his message,
which ran, “How does it happen that you have made peace
with the Manchus?” The king made reply, “The Manchus
overwhelmed us with their vast numbers and it meant either
a treaty or our extinction. We had no time to send and explain
matters to the Emperor.” The Emperor sent a reply
to this saying, “I have received your reply and I am truly
sorry for you. You are in no wise to blame. Now hoard
your wealth and by-and-bye you and I will rise and strike
these Manchus to the earth.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be remembered that the king had sent one of his
relatives as hostage to the Manchus, but now, according to
the stipulations of the treaty, he came back, escorted by the
Manchu general Yu Hă. The king sent high officials to
meet them outside the South Gate, but this did not satisfy
the Manchu, who was angry that the king did not come in person.
So the king had to go out and meet them and give a
feast to the returning party. When Gen. Yu Hă met the
king he wanted to kiss him, saying that it was a custom by
which he showed friendship and a demonstration that the
oath still held firm between them; but the king refused the
osculatory salute and so the general compromised by patting
him on the back.</p>

<p class='c000'>Late in this year two dangerous conspiracies were made
against the government. The first was by Yi In-jo a former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>official living in Kang-wŭn Province. He had a goodly following
among the people and made bold to liberate all the
criminals. After looting several towns he went into camp
on a mountain top. The government troops, however, surrounded
him and finally captured him and sent him up to the
capital where he was beheaded together with his two sons.
The other attempt was of a different nature. Yu Hyo-rip,
an exile in Che-ch‘ŭn, a relative of the deposed king’s wife,
decided to work up an insurrection. He sent his son up to
Seoul in disguise to make arrangements with a disloyal eunuch.
Soldiers also came disguised as merchants, but all
armed to the teeth. The palace was to be seized on the
fourth day of the new year. As fortune would have it. Hŭ
Chŭk, a relative of one of the conspirators, learned of the plot
in time, but only just in time, to inform the Prime Minister.
So when the attack was made the whole party was seized and
with them Yu Hyo-rip himself, who had come up to Seoul in
woman’s clothes and in a woman’s chair. Being questioned
about the affair he testified that he was not the prime mover
in the matter but that he had been set on by the queen dowager,
who wanted to put the king’s uncle on the throne.
That aged and respectable woman indignantly denied any
knowledge of the plot and as proof of her innocence she
urged that the said uncle be put to death. All united in this
request and it was finally granted, though against the better
instincts of the king who believed him innocent. We shall
see later that the king was right.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Manchus were still fretful. A letter came post haste
from the north saying, “We have now sent back many captives
and you agreed to pay for the rest, but when they got
across the border and were lost to us we never saw the money.
Not a year has passed since the treaty was ratified and yet
you break it with impunity. When the Chinese acted thus
we retaliated by seizing twenty-four of their districts. Now
you must send those men straight back to us.” Among all
the courtiers there was but one dissenting voice, that of Chang
Yu, who said, “The government is for the people and if it
gives up any of the people thus, from that hour it ceases to
be a government. Sooner should we let the Manchus destroy
the government outright than comply with such a demand.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>This carried the day, and an envoy was sent north bearing a
present of a magnificent sword, 300 pounds of ginseng, seventy
sable skins, but only five of the men demanded. The Manchus
were highly pleased and forgave all that had been done
to displease them. The Japanese hearing of this again sent
an envoy saying, “Those Manchus are a bold lot. They have
made a treaty with you but they do not treat you well. Just
say the word and we will come and whip them for you.”
This frightened the king and he wanted to forward the message
to the Manchus but Kim Sin-guk said, “If you do that
you will get the Manchus and the Japanese to fighting each
other on Korean soil and we will be the little fish between
two whales.” This argument carried the day.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1629 the king established a naval station
on Kyo-dong Island and placed there an admiral to guard
that island and Kang-wha from attack from the seaward
side. This was with the expectation that the court might
again find it necessary to seek asylum on the island of Kang-wha.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Chinese general. Mo Mun-nyŭng, had been stationed
by the Emperor on Ka-do Island near the mouth of the Yalu,
to withstand the Manchus, but this man was not loyal to
China, and had a leaning himself toward the Manchus. He
could see that the Manchus were destined to become masters
of the situation. He was very angry when Korea made a
treaty with the Manchus for he feared that they would try to
hurt his reputation with them. When the Manchus attacked
the Chinese in the neighboring mainland of Liao-tung he
never raised a hand in their defense, though it <a id='corr91.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='in'>is</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_91.27'>is</a></span> said, perhaps
wrongly, that he had an army of 300,000 (!) men. On the
other hand he vented his spite against Korea by harrying her
northern shores and killing many captives on their way home
from the Manchu territory. The Emperor tried to call him
to account for this but received no reply. Meanwhile this
Gen. Mo Mun-nyŭng styled himself “Son of Heaven beyond
the Sea.” As he thus showed his hand, the question as to his
disloyalty was settled, and Gen. Wŭn Sung-han came from
China to call him to account, a thing he had not foreseen.
When Gen. Wŭn approached and called on him to come and
report to him, he dared not refuse, fearing that the troops under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>him would not be willing to attack their fellow-countrymen
under Gen. Wŭn. As may be surmised he lost his head
as soon as he arrived in the camp of the latter.</p>

<p class='c000'>In spite of her military activity Korea was anything but
strong. The two leading parties, the <em>Noron</em> and <em>Soron</em> were
quarrelling like cats and dogs together. There was one constant
succession of banishments and recalls, as one party or
another obtained temporary control of the government. There
was no sort of harmony or unanimity in the discharge of the
public business and it had to look out for itself, while those
who should have been attending to it were wrangling. There
was a high honorary title called Chŭl-lang, and the leading
men quarrelled so much over it that the king was at last compelled
to abolish it altogether. And yet in the midst of this
strife the king found opportunity to establish the Mu-hak, a
body of 200 men to act as swift couriers. It is said they could
cover 300 <em>li</em> a day, or 100 miles.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Manchu Gen. Yu Hă, of whom we have spoken, was
originally a Chinaman living in Liao-tung, but had gone over
to the Manchus. The Emperor was furious at this and offered
a reward of 1,000 ounces of silver and high position to anyone
who should apprehend him. For a time he went under an
assumed name, but finally with his three brothers he came to
Gen. Mo Mun-nyŭng whom he knew to be secretly disloyal
to China. When Gen. Mo had been executed Gen. Yu came
of course under the jurisdiction of Gen. Wŭn. Shortly after
this Gen. Yu was killed in a battle but his three brothers decided
to rise up against the loyal Chinaman. In the midst of
the funeral obsequies of their brother they rose and killed Gen.
Chin who had been left in charge of the Chinese forces, and
they tried to kill the Koreans as well, but in this they were
unsuccessful and shortly afterward were driven out by the
Korean forces. When the Emperor heard of this he was highly
pleased and praised the Koreans.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Manchus naturally considered this occupation of
Ka-do as a menace to them and they sent a force of 20,000 men
to attack the Chinese, at the same time demanding boats of
the Koreans whereby to transport their troops. This was not
granted, but the Koreans, in order to avoid the effects of a
too evident leaning towards the Chinese, gave the Manchus 200
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>bags of rice. But the Chinese did not wait for the Manchus
to cross to the island. They crossed to the mainland and attacked
the Manchus unexpectedly, killing 400 and putting the
rest to flight.</p>

<p class='c000'>During this year, 1631, an envoy to China, Chong Tu-wŭn,
while in Nanking, fell in with an aged Roman Catholic priest
named Jean Niouk, who engaged the attention of the envoy
because of his venerable and almost saint-like appearance.
This man was one of the companions of the celebrated P. Ricci.
From him the envoy received some volumes on science, a pair
of pistols, a telescope and some other articles. The mention
of a cannon in the native records is probably a mistake of some
copyist who wrote the word cannon in place of pistol.</p>

<p class='c000'>The king was told by his officials that the Manchus were
sure to invade Korea again before long and so the island of
Kang-wha was well provisioned and arms were prepared. He
was urged to form a junction with the Chinese on Ka-do Island
and make an attack on the Manchus. The fortresses of
Ch’ŭl-san and Un-san in P‘yŭng-an Province were built at
this time and every effort was made to put the country in a
state of defense against the northern hordes. A fortress was
also built near Eui-ju, which was the equivalent of a declaration
of war against the Manchus. The result was soon apparent.
A Manchu envoy made his appearance bearing a
missive which said, “Korea has seen fit to break her treaty
with us and she is no longer to be called ‘younger brother,’
but a vassal state. She shall pay us annually a tribute of
10,000 ounces of gold, 10,000 ounces of silver, 10,000,000
pieces of linen.” The king replied that he had no gold but
that he would give some tiger skins. These the envoy scornfully
refused and returned to the north. The king was somewhat
disturbed by this and ordered an envoy to go to Manchuria
with gifts, but they were all returned untouched. At
this the king was furious and ordered an envoy to go and say
that Korea would never again send tribute nor make peace
with the Manchus. Kim Si-yang expostulated with the king
and told him that such a message would be suicidal, but he
was banished on the spot. It is probable the message never
reached the Manchu camp, for we learn that with the opening
of new year the king had <a id='corr93.40'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='some'>come</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_93.40'>come</a></span> to his senses and sent tribute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>to the north to the extent of 800 pieces of silk, 800 pieces
of linen, 800 pieces of grass cloth, 800 pieces of cotton, 60
tiger skins, 300 sea-otter skins and 800 quires of heavy
paper.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Korean territory became the asylum for several renegade
Chinese generals who demanded sustenance, and what
between these and the Manchus it became well-nigh impossible
to keep on good terms either with the Emperor or
with the Manchus. The latter were continually ravaging
the northern border and were, apparently losing all their
former feeling of friendship. This cannot be wondered at,
for the king was openly siding with the Chinese.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the spring of 1636 the king ordered a remeasurement
of all the arable land in the three southern provinces. It
seems that the people were thriving and the margin of cultivation
was broadening so that a remeasurement became
necessary for a re-estimate of the revenue. At the same time
he <a id='corr94.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='despatehed'>despatched</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_94.18'>despatched</a></span> two envoys to the Manchu court at Mukden.
The Manchus had just begun to style their empire the Ch’ing
or “clear.” And now for the first time we meet the names
of the two great Manchu generals who were destined to play
such a prominent part in the invasion of Korea. They were
called Yonggoldă and Mabudă. These two men came to the
Yalu River and received the king’s missive addressed to the
son of the Ch’ing Emperor. The two envoys were brought
into the Manchu Emperor’s presence, where they were ordered
to bow, but refused. They were forced to a stooping position,
but resisted, whereupon they were stripped, beaten and
driven away.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Manchus were now fully determined to invade
Korea and bring her to her knees once more. In preparation
for this the two generals above named were sent to Seoul
as envoys, but in reality to spy out the land and learn the
<a id='corr94.34'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='roads'>roads.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_94.34'>roads.</a></span> The officials almost with one voice urged the king to
burn the letters brought by these envoys and to kill the men
themselves. To show the extent of the infatuation of the
Koreans it is necessary to subjoin a memorial which was presented
the king at this time. It said “Since I was born I
have never heard of two <ins class='correction' title='emperors'>emperors.</ins> How can these wild
savages claim imperial power? Once before a rebel (referring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>to Kang Hong-rip) came with these robbers and the king
was compelled to flee to Kang-wha. If at that time we had
only cut off the traitor’s head it would have been to our honor
and it would have shone like the sun and moon. These
Manchu robbers are wolves and tigers. How can we think
of casting off our allegiance to China? All our troubles have
arisen because we did not kill Gen. Kang. This news about
the Manchus rends my heart, for, though we live in a distant
corner of the world, we have manners. From King T’ă-jo’s
time till now we have been loyal to the Ming power.
Now that the northern savages are growing strong and we,
through fear, are compelled to follow them, we may for a
time escape harm, but in the end the world will scorn us.
It was a mistake for the government to give those envoys a
polite reception, and now the officials sit still while the king
is being insulted by outsiders. Our situation is not only
dangerous, it is pitiable. Here we sit and do nothing to prevent
the enemy entering our territory. I see what the
Manchus want. They know we are weak, and they want to
hold us in their hand and make a boast of us. If they want
to play at empire why do they not do it among themselves
and not come to us with it? They do it so as to be able to
say that they have Korea in their train. Now let us be
men and cut off these envoys’ heads and put them in a box
along with their insulting letter and send the whole back to
their so-called emperor. If the king does not like my advice
let him cut off my head and send it. I cannot live to see and
hear the insults of these savages. The people of the <a id='corr95.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='nothern'>northern</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_95.26'>northern</a></span>
provinces grind their teeth at them and swear that they cannot
live with them. Today must decide the continued existence
or the destruction of this kingdom. The king should
send out a proclamation far and wide for the people to flock
to the support of the royal banners. Then would we all rejoice
to die, if need be, for our country.” This speech is probably
an exact expression of the feeling of the vast majority
of the officials and people at that time, but most of them had
the good sense to keep still, for such talk was sure to bring
swift retribution. It is evident the king thought so, for he
answered this warm appeal by saying, “You have spoken
very well but it is a little <a id='corr95.39'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='permature'>premature</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_95.39'>premature</a></span> for us to go to cutting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>off the heads of envoys from a neighboring power; we will
consider the matter however.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Manchu envoys had with them some Mongol soldiers
to prove to the Koreans that the Mongols had actually surrendered
to the Manchu power. The envoys asked that these
be treated well, but the king had them treated as slaves.
The object of the embassy was nominally to attend the funeral
of the king’s grandmother, but the king deceived them by
sending them to an enclosure in the place where a screen was
closely drawn around. The envoys supposed this was the
obsequies and began their genuflections, but a violent gust
of wind blew the screens over and they saw that they had
been duped. They immediately were seized with fear lest
they be foully dealt with and rushing out they mounted
their steeds and fled by way of the South Gate. The boys
pelted them with stones as they passed. The people knew
that this was a serious matter and messenger after messenger
was sent after the fleeing envoys pleading with them to come
back, but of course without avail.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prime Minister told the king that war was now inevitable
and that it was necessary to call the people to arms
at once. The king consented and the proclamation went
forth saying. “Ten years ago we made a treaty with these
Manchus, but their nature is so bad and they are so insulting
that we never before were so ashamed. From the king,
down to the lowest subject all must unite in wiping out this
<a id='corr96.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='disgrace'>disgrace.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_96.27'>disgrace.</a></span> They now claim to be an empire and that we are
their vassal. Such insolence cannot be borne. It may mean
the overthrow of our kingdom but we could do no less than
drive the envoys away. All the people saw them go. Of
course it means immediate war and all the people must now
come up to their responsibilities and swear to be avenged on
the Manchus even at the cost of life itself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Manchu envoys delayed on Korean soil long enough
to secure a copy of the proclamation and, armed with this,
they crossed the border and made their way to the Manchu
headquarters.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Seoul there were various counsels. One side argued that
the palace at Kang-wha should be burned so that the king’s
mind might not turn toward that as an asylum. Others said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>that the king should go to P‘yung-yang and lead the army in
person. We are told that there were many omens of impending
danger at this time. They are of course fictitious, but
they show the bent of the Korean mind. They say that at
one place large stones moved from place to place of their own
accord. In another place ducks fought on the water and killed
each other. In another place a great flock of storks congregated
in one place and made a “camp.” Outside the South
Gate there was a great fight among the frogs. In the south,
toads came out and hopped about in mid-winter. A pond in
the palace became red like blood. In summer the river rose so
high that it lapped the foundations of the East Gate. At
twenty-seven different places in Seoul the land rose and fell.
Such are some of the popular <a id='corr97.14'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='supersititions'>superstitions</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_97.14'>superstitions</a></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chinese general in charge of troops on Ka-do Island
sent word to the Emperor that Korea had broken with the
Manchus, whereupon the Emperor sent a letter congratulating
the king and praising his boldness. The Chinese envoy
further said, “I came to bring the letter of praise from the
Emperor but at the same time he recognises the great danger
in which you are and he grants permission for you to conclude
a peace with them if you so wish.” But the king had decided
on the arbitrament of war and this pointed hint was not
taken.</p>

<p class='c000'>The king had now collected an army in P’yŭng-yang and
he gave each soldier a present of cotton cloth. The whole
number of the army is not given, but we are told that there
were 10,234 skillful archers and 700 musketeers. It seems
that the review did not satisfy all, for one of the leading officials
said, “If we take this final step and go to war we shall
all perish, so it might be well to send an envoy and try to
patch up matters with them.” To this another replied hotly,
“All the people are bent on war and are determined to rid
themselves of these savages. You are a traitor to your country
to talk of sending an envoy. You are insulting the king.
You are over-riding the will of the great majority.” But the
other answered calmly, “We have no army that can stand before
them an hour and some fine morning we shall all he found
dead in bed. There is no place to take the ancestral tablets,
so my advice is to send generals to P’yŭng-yang and have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>soldiers well drilled, and at the same time send an envoy to
the Manchus to see how they talk. It may be that things may
be so arranged that we can go along quietly as before. At
any rate it will give us time to prepare. If worse comes to
worst and we have to defend the Yalu we will do our best, but
it is evident that if they once cross we will necessarily become
supplicants.” This was too good logic to be withstood and
yet it was worse than nothing, for it was either just too strong
or just too weak, and it threw the whole court into a fatal uncertainty.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the tenth moon the Manchu general Mabudă, appeared
on the west bank of the Yalu and sent word to the prefect
of Eui-ju saying. “On the twenty-sixth of the next moon our
armies are to move on Korea, but if within that time you send
an envoy we will desist, even though it be at the last moment.”
Gen. Kim Nyu told the king this and urged that the envoy
be sent, but only an interpreter was sent with a letter to the
Manchu chief. When the Manchus saw this man they said
“Go back and tell the king that if he does not send his son
and the Prime Minister and another high official to perform
the treaty ceremony before the twenty fifth of the next moon,
our armies will instantly be put in motion.” Yonggoldă
brought out the copy of the proclamation he had brought with
him from Korea and said, “Look at this. It cannot be said
that it was we who broke the treaty first.” A letter was given
the messenger for the king in which was written, “They say
you are building many forts. Is it to block my way to your
capital? They say you are building a palace on Kang-wha to
find refuge in. When I have taken your eight provinces will
Kang-wha be of any use to you? Can your councillors overcome
me with a writing-brush?”</p>

<p class='c000'>When this ominous letter reached Seoul the king and the
highest of the officials wanted to make terms with the Manchus
at once, but they were opposed stoutly by the whole mass
of the lesser officials. At last however a man was dispatched
to convey the acceptance by Korea of the Manchu terms; but
the fatal day had passed, and when the messenger met the
Manchus advancing upon Eui-ju, he was seized. As war was
now beyond peradventure Generals Kim Nyu and Kim Cha-jŭm
advised that the prefectural towns along the route that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Manchus would come be moved back from the main road.
This was ordered and the prefectures of Eui-ju, P’yŭng-yang
and Whang-ju were moved from ten to a hundred <em>li</em> back.
All the towns along the way were deserted by their inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gen. Kim Cha-jŭm forced the people at the point of the
sword to rebuild the fortress at Chöng-bang Mountain, but he
did not attempt to guard the Yalu, for he was possessed
by the the infatuation that the Manchus would not come after
all. There was a line of fire-signal mountains from Eui-ju
all the way to Seoul but he ordered the fires to be lighted only
as far as his quarters, in case of war, as it would cause great
consternation in the capital. His criminal incredulity and
carelessness were so great that when in the twelfth moon the
double fires gleamed forth along the line from the north telling
of the approach of an invading army, he still averred that
it was nothing more nor less than the envoy heralding his return.
He sent no messages nor warnings to Seoul. He sent
a messenger north to discover where the Manchus were. This
man came running back and announced that the north was full
of them. Still the general would not believe it and wanted to
kill the man for deceiving him. The report was however
confirmed by so many eye-witnesses that he was at last compelled
to believe it and sent word to Seoul that the Manchus
had come. On the twelfth a letter from the prefect of Eui-ju
announced in Seoul that the Manchus had crossed the river
140,000 strong. The next day a letter from the tardy Kim
announced that the Manchus had already traversed the province
of P‘yŭng-an. This news was like a thunder-bolt from
a clear sky to the people of the capital. They were thrown
into a panic and are described as having resembled boiling
water. The roads were choked with fugitives from the city.
The king said, “Liberate all the captives and prisoners and
grant an amnesty to all who have been banished.” All prefects
who had not gone to their posts were sent forthwith.
The king desired to start at once for Kang-wha, and he appointed
Kim Kyŭng-jeung to have military control there with
Yi Min-gu as second. An aged Minister Yun Pang together
with Kim Sang-yong took the ancestral tablets and went ahead
to that island. Then followed the Queen and the Princes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Finally the king appointed Sin Keui-wŭn to guard the capital.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the fourteenth the Manchu army entered Whang-hă
Province and almost immediately the news came that they
had arrived at Chang-dan only 120 <em>li</em> from Seoul. There
they caught the prefect, cut off his hair, dressed him in Manchu
clothes and forced him to act as guide. At noon the
next day the king and the Crown Prince passed out the
South Gate on their way to Kang-wha, when suddenly messengers
came hurrying up saying that the Manchu horsemen
had already arrived at Yang-wha-jin on the river and that
the road to Kang-wha was consequently blocked. The king
and his immediate followers went up into the pavilion above
the gate and conferred together. The native chronicler says
that “their faces were white and their voices were like the
croaking of country frogs.” And well they might be. Chi
Yö-hă said, “They have come down from the border in five
days and must be very tired. I will take 500 men and go
out and hold them in check until the king can get to Kang-wha.”
But Ch’oe Myŭng-gil said, “We must decide immediately,
for the enemy is at our very doors. We cannot fight
them, but I will go out the gate and parley with them and
meantime the king can escape to Nam-han.” To this the
king eagerly assented and Ch’oe took ten cattle and ten tubs
of wine and went out to meet the enemy. All the gates on
the south side of Seoul were closed and the king and his suite
started for the East Gate. The crown prince’s groom ran
away and the prince was compelled to hold the bridle himself.
The people crowded around the royal party so closely that it
was almost impossible to move, but finally the gate was passed
and the party hurried forward. At seven o’clock that
night the royal cavalcade entered the welcome gate of Nam-han.
So rapid had been the pace that only six men in the
king’s retinue remained until they arrived at their destination.
The rest arrived some time before midnight. They all
urged the king to start at day light and reach Kang-wha by a
circuitous route. This was determined upon, but a storm of
sleet and rain came on, which rendered the roads so slippery
that the king was compelled to dismount and walk. It soon
became evident that this would not do. The king was very
cold and the progress was hopelessly slow. So they placed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>him in a litter hastily extemporised and brought him back to
the fortress. It turned out that this was fortunate, for the
Manchus had guarded every approach to Kang-wha so <a id='corr101.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='carefuly'>carefully</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_101.3'>carefully</a></span>
that the king never would have been able to get through.
Gen. Ch’oe, who had gone to parley with the enemy, went
beyond the Peking Pass and met Gen. Mabudă and said,
“We made a treaty with you some time since, but now you
come down upon us with this great array. How is this?”
The Manchu answered. “It is not we who have broken the
treaty but you, and we have come to learn from the king the
reason of it.” Gen. Ch’oe replied, “Well, you cannot see
him. He has gone to the fortress of Nam-han.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Together they entered Seoul and there the Manchu general
had Gen. Ch’oe send a letter to the king as follows, “The
Manchu general has come to make a treaty with us, but he
says we are all afraid of him and that even the king has fled.
He says that if the king wants to make peace he must send
his son and the prime minister together with the man who
advised the king to break the treaty. They demand an immediate
answer.” That night no answer came and Mabudă
charged Gen. Ch’oe with having deceived him and wanted to
kill him on the spot, but the rest dissuaded him saying “Let
us go to Nam-han ourselves.” They made Gen. Ch’oe act
as guide and soon they stood before that renowned fortress.
Gen. Ch’oe went ahead and entered alone. The king seized
his hand and said, “You are come to save us.” But the general
said “The Manchu general was exceedingly angry because
you did not answer my letter last night, so he has now come
with a third of his whole force. In order to pacify him we
cannot but comply with his three conditions.” The king replied,
“You are deceived by him. Do you think he has come
all this way to be satisfied so easily as that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Manchu army encamped along the southern side of
the city from Mo-wha-gwan to the South Gate and outside the
East Gate, and the air resounded with the sound of music and
drums. At first the soldiers committed no excesses beyond
the theft of a few cattle and an occasional woman, but now
that it was learned that the king had run away to Nam-han
the license became unbounded and men and women were
killed in large numbers. The royal treasure houses were
looted and nothing was too sacred to be dragged about the
streets. That same night a band of the Manchus completely
encircled Nam-han, which must be well-nigh ten miles
around.</p>

<p class='c000'>The king set a strong guard all about the wall, appointing
Gen. Sin Kyöng-jin to guard the East Gate, Gen. Ku
Kweng the South Gate, Gen. Yi Sö the North Gate and Gen.
Yi Si-băk the West Gate. Generals Wŭn Tu-p‘yo, Ku In-hu,
Han Whe-il and Pak Whan went all about the wall with
strong bodies of troops, to prevent the entrance of any scaling
party. The whole number of troops in the fortress was
about 12,000. Gen. Nam An-gap held the important position
of Commissariat Chief. The king’s retinue and court consisted
of 200 officials, 200 of his relatives, 100 clerks, and
300 servants of different degrees. All these received their
salary in rice. Officials of the first and second grades
were allowed to have three servants and two horses, those of
the third, fourth and fifth grades could have two servants and
one horse, while those below these could have but one servant
and one horse, The commander-in-chief was Gen. Kim Nyu.
His advice to the king was to send the crown prince and the
prime minister at once and make the best terms possible.
It was decided to deceive the enemy if possible, so Neung
Pong-su, a distant relative of the king, assumed the name of
the king’s younger brother, and Sim Chip assumed the role of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>crown prince. Together they sallied out to try their hand on
the Manchus. When they came before Mabudă, that hardheaded
warrior looked them over, turned them inside out
and sent them back to the king with the curt reply that, “As
you have been trying to play a trick on us we will now consent
to treat with no one whatever except the crown prince
himself. If you will send him we will talk with you.” This
they demanded in spite of the statements of the messengers
that the crown prince was still in mourning for his mother.</p>

<p class='c000'>When this ultimatum was delivered to the king there
was a division of opinion. Gen. Kim Nyu and several others
averred that there was nothing to do but comply with the
demands But the king said, “I will die first.” Kim Sang-hön
took the other side and said, “Whoever talks of surrendering
so tamely is a traitor.” On the seventeenth the king
sent Hong Sö-bong to the Manchu camp and said, “I am willing
to send my second or third son to you but they are all in
Kang-wha.” They answered as before, “We will see no one
but the crown prince.” When the crown prince expressed
his willingness to go, a courtier said, “We have a good strong
garrison and shall we tamely surrender and send our future
king into the clutches of these highwaymen? If he goes I
shall strangle myself with my own <ins class='correction' title='bridle'>bridle.</ins>” Another said,
“Let us fight them. We are men, not straw manikins.” So
the king made up his mind that it would be war and not surrender
and he so proclaimed, “We shall fight to the bitter
end. Let no one expect or hope for peace.” He then despatched
a letter to Kim Cha-jŭm in P’yŭng-yang, saying “We
are hemmed in here and our forces are small and food scarce,
but we have determined to fight it out even though it ends
the dynasty. So hasten and come to our aid with all the forces
at your command.” The next day the guard of the North
Gate made a successful sally, returning with six Manchu
heads. This excited the soldiers almost to frenzy, and they
were eager to rush out and engage the besiegers. Unfortunately
all the rice that had been stored at the river for the
<a id='corr103.36'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='provisoning'>provisioning</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_103.36'>provisioning</a></span> of Nam-han had been seized by the Manchus,
but the arms and ammunition were safe within the walls.
The king took advantage of the elation of the soldiers over
this successful sally to make them a little speech, in which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>remarked, “Shall we surrender or fight? It is for you to
say.” Sim Kwang-su answered grimly for them all and said
“Show us the head of the man who advised to surrender.”
This referred to Gen. Ch’oe Myŭng-gil, but the rest did
not dare to second the request. From that time the walls
were guarded with renewed vigilance. Day after day the
smoke of the Manchu camps went up to heaven round about
the <a id='corr104.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>beleagured</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_104.8'>beleagured</a></span> fortress. On the nineteenth the king sacrificed
at the tomb of On-jo, the founder of the ancient kingdom
of Păk-je of which Nam-han was for many years the
capital. On the same day Gen. Ku Kweng made a sally from
the West Gate and took twenty Manchu heads. This again
excited the garrison almost beyond control. The following
day a renegade Korean who had gone over to the Manchus
came near the gate and parleyed with the guard, urging that
the king surrender and make peace; but when the king heard
of it he ordered that if the man came again he should not be
met at the gate but that the guard should only talk down at
him from the top of the wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>The matter of provisions was one of prime importance,
and the king called the chief of commissariat and asked him
how many days’ rations there were remaining in the store-houses.
He replied that there were enough provisions to
last sixty days, but that if great economy were exercised it
might last seventy days. He said the horses could have but
one measure of beans a day and the servants must get along
as best they could, on barley and oats. Someone suggested
that as there were a large number of people present who held
no important position, the king ought not to feel obliged to
support them, but the king vetoed this by saying, “They
came here trusting in me and now shall I deprive them of
food? No, we will all eat or go hungry together.” The
weather was very cold and the men exposed upon the wall
suffered severely. Their cheeks, being frost-bitten, cracked
open in a very painful manner. In view of this the king
ordered that night guards be dispensed with and that no old
or feeble men should be put on picket duty in these exposed
positions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The king again sent out a letter to the governors of the
different provinces saying, “We are here hemmed in; our life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>hangs by a thread. Let all loyal men rally to our support,
and march against the besieging force.” To Kim Cha-jŭm he
wrote, “For seven days we have now been immured and we
have come to the brink of destruction. Come immediately to
our aid.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On the twenty-first there were two simultaneous sallies,
from the East and West Gates respectively, and each resulted
in the securing of a few trophies. For the encouragement of
the soldiers Kim Sin-guk suggested that a schedule of rates
be issued offering prizes for Manchu heads. The king’s
intention not to surrender was still unshaken, for when a
courtier memorialized him urging surrender he burned the
document in anger. On the twenty-second a Manchu messenger
rode up to the gate and asked if the king were ready
to surrender yet. The answer came in the shape of fierce
sallies on the South and East sides in which forty heads were
taken and in which Gen. Yi Chi-wŭn, with an iron club, killed
two mounted generals. The soldiers were so elated by these
successes, which of course could make no difference in the
strength of the besieging force, that on the following day they
made simultaneous attacks on several sides, in each of which
the Koreans had some advantage. The Koreans lost but
twenty men while the Manchu loss was much greater. As
the Manchus carried their dead from the field, however, the
exact amount of their loss is not known. The king celebrated
the victory by making a circuit of the wall. The next day
was wet and foggy and the cold was even harder to endure
than when the weather was clear. Both the king and the
crown prince came out in the rain to encourage the soldiers
and they and many of the officials gave mats and blankets
and the mud-guards of their saddles to help the soldiers to
keep dry. The inmates of Han-heung Monastery, inside the
fortress, presented the king with forty quires of paper, and
several bags of vegetables, but the king distributed them all
among the soldiers. Other monks presented three large bowls
of honey, for which the king thanked them and gave presents
in return.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the twenty-fifth the Manchus completed a wattle
fence completely encircling the fortress. It was thirty miles
long and twice the height of a man. Some idea can be formed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>of the numbers in the Manchu army when we know that
this was completed in seven days. Every eighty paces a bell
was attached in such a way that if anyone attempted to break
through, warning would be given to the sentinels.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were those outside who sincerely desired to give
succor to the king and the court. Gen. Kwŭn Chöng-gil, of
Wŭn-ju, gathered a small force and camped on Kŭm-dan mountain
in plain sight of Nam-han, and the king was greatly encouraged,
hoping that the Koreans were rallying to his support.
When this loyal band attacked the Manchus they were
immediately overwhelmed and cut to pieces.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Manchus caught every Korean they could lay hands
on. The more vigorous of these they forced into their ranks,
the old men were made hewers of wood and drawers of water,
the young women were made concubines and the older women
were compelled to cook and wash.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the twenty-eighth the king sent a present of a bullock
and ten bottles of wine to the Manchu headquarters, but received
the reply, “Heaven has given us all Korea and we have
no need of these things. Take them back to your starving
soldiers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Chöng Se-gyu, the governor of Ch’ung-ch’ŭng Province,
was consumed with grief on hearing that the king was reduced
to two side-dishes with his rice; so he gave a monk two
pheasants and told him to effect an entrance in some way or
other and give them to the king. The governor himself came
with a handful of men to Ma-heui-ch’ŭn, only forty <em>li</em> from
the beleaguered fortress, and there he was attacked in the
rear by the enemy. His whole force was annihilated, though
he himself escaped by leaping into a deep gorge, intending to
commit suicide. But the fall was not fatal. Nam Yang, also,
the prefect of Yun-gye, wanted to do what he could, and when
he learned of the distress of the king, he arose even on his
wedding night and started for the seat of war. His little
force was surrounded and he was ordered to surrender, and
then it was that he made that memorable reply, “You can conquer
my neck but never my knees.” His tongue was cut
out and his body was dismembered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gen. Kim Nyu had the idea that the Manchu force was
weakest on the south and that if a sudden, determined attack
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>were made the line might be broken through. So on the
twenty-ninth he called all the generals and gave his orders.
They all disagreed with him and considered the project hopeless,
but would not show insubordination. A considerable
body, therefore, emerged from the South Gate, hastened down
the valley against the surrounding line of <a id='corr107.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='beseigers'>besiegers</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_107.5'>besiegers</a></span>. These
men had no faith in the plan, however, and were prevented
from turning back only by the sword of Gen. Kim Nyu which
he used on a few as a warning to the rest. Gen. Sin said,
“This is actual suicide. Let me take my company and go out
here and show you at the cost of my life that this cannot be
done.” He pushed rapidly forward and was soon surrounded
by the Manchus who had lain concealed in a bend of the hills,
and he and his men were all cut down. When the ammunition
of his men was gone they clubbed their muskets and
fought to the bitter end. Two hundred Koreans fell in this
rash adventure and Gen. Kim returned crest-fallen and
ashamed. Having no excuse, he tried to lay the blame on
others, claiming that they did not support him properly. He
also told the king that only forty men had been killed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sim Keui-wŭn who had been left as guardian of Seoul
sent a letter to the king saying that he had made a fierce attack
on the Manchus encamped at A-o-gă outside the West
Gate, but the king afterwards learned that this was false, and
that Sim had fled incontinently from before the face of the
foe.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the last day of the year 1636 arrived it found the
relative position of the Koreans and Manchus as follows: The
Manchu camps were filled with plunder and with women
which the soldiers had captured; but what of the children?
These the soldiery did not want, and so they were killed and
their bodies thrown outside the camps. There they lay in
piles and a pestilence was prevented only by the intense cold
of winter. In Nam-han the greatest distress prevailed. The
provisions had not held out as had been hoped. Food was all but
exhausted and horses and cattle were dying of starvation. The
king slept in his ordinary clothes, for he had given all his
blankets to the soldiers. All he had to eat with his rice was
the leg or wing of a chicken. On that last day of the year
some magpies gathered and began building a nest in a tree near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>the king’s quarters. This was hailed as a hopeful omen. It
shows to what straits the garrison was reduced that it should
have pinned its faith to this childish superstition. It was the
sole subject of conversation for some time, but it did the caged
Korean king no good.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day was new years day of 1637 and the king
sent Kim Sin-guk and Yi Kyŭng-jik to the Manchu camp to
offer the compliments of the season. They were there informed
that the emperor’s son had arrived and had inspected
the army and the forts. Consequently on the following day
Hong Sö-bong, Kim Sin-guk and Yi Kyŭng-jik hastened to
his headquarters and were met, not by the emperor’s son but
by a general who said, “You have called us slaves and thieves
but our course has been straight and consistent throughout.”
He then laid before them an edict of the emperor written on
yellow paper, and they were ordered to bow before it. Its
contents were as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>“The great, the good, the wise, the kind Emperor to the
king of Korea. As you preferred allegiance to the Ming Emperor
rather than to us and, not content with throwing us
over, despised and insulted us, you now have an opportunity
to see the fruits of your choice. Of a truth you acted wickedly
in breaking your oath, in throwing off the Manchu yoke
and in offering us armed opposition. I have now brought an
immense army and have surrounded your eight provinces.
How can you longer hope to render assistance to your “father,”
the Ming Emperor? The Mings are now hung up by the
heels, as it were.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On the next day the king sent his answer couched in the
following terms: “The great, the glorious, the righteous
Emperor. The little country has indeed sinned against the
great one and has drawn upon herself this trouble which lies
hard by the door of destruction. We have long wanted to
write thus but we have been so surrounded and hemmed in
that it seemed well-nigh impossible to get a letter through
the lines; but now that the Emperor’s son himself has come,
we rejoice, and yet we tremble. The Ming Emperor is no
longer our suzerain. In this we have completely reformed.
The people on the border have acted badly in ill-treating the
Manchu envoys. We are truly on the brink of destruction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>and we confess all our sin. It is for us to confess and for the
Emperor to forgive. From this day forth we wash from our
mind all other thought of allegiance and enter upon a new
line of conduct. If the Emperor will not forgive, we can only
bow the head and die.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When this abject document was read before the court,
before sending it, some thought it too humble, but the leaders
said it was the only course left; so it was forwarded to the
Manchu camp. Answer was returned that the Emperor’s
son had not yet arrived but that when he came he would reply.
Strange to say no truce was made and the Manchu soldiers,
fearing perhaps that a truce might rob them of the
pleasure of scaling those walls that had defied them so long,
approached the wall that very night and with scaling ladders
a considerable number effected an entrance. But they had
underestimated the determination and courage of the defenders,
and those who got in were quickly dispersed by Gen. Yi
Si-băk. Many Manchus fell in this desperate assault. Almost
at the same hour a similar attack was made on the south side
but there also the Manchus were check-mated by the watchful
guard.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now a diversion occurred. Generals Hŏ Wan and
Min Yöng from the provinces approached with a force of 40,000
men and seriously threatened the Manchu flank. They
were stationed on two opposite hills with a line of sharpshooters
between. In the fight which ensued the Koreans
held their ground gallantly and at first even made the invaders
retreat; but this exhausted their ammunition and when
the enemy reformed his lines and came on again to the attack
there was nothing to do but retreat. The retreat became a
rout and large numbers of Koreans were cut down, including
Gen. Hŏ Wan. The other part of the army under Gen. Min
Yöng held out a little longer but an unfortunate accident occurred
which threw his troops into confusion. A large quantity
of powder which was being paid out to the soldiers suddenly
exploded killing a large number of men and depriving
the rest of means for continuing the fight. So they met the
same fate as the others. Those that the Manchus killed they
stripped and burned but many fugitives likewise died of exposure
and fatigue.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Gen. Sim Yun had been fortifying Cho-ryŭng (Pass) but
when he heard of the rout of the 40,000 men he took fright
and retreated precipitately, telling all he met that there was
no use in attempting to do anything. Gen. Kim Chun-yong,
however, had more perseverance and came and encamped
twenty miles from Nam-han, occupying a position that was
specially annoying to the enemy. A fight was the result, in
which the Koreans were at first successful, but during the
night the Manchus were reinforced and cannon were brought
to bear upon the Koreans. All the next day the Koreans
fought desperately. Night put an end to the battle and the
Koreans finding that all their ammunition was gone, silently
separated, burning all bridges as they went.</p>

<p class='c000'>The admiral of Chŭl-la Province desired to render aid to
the king and so getting together a little fleet of boats he came
north to Kang-wha and joined the royal forces there. The
governor of Kang-wŭn Province excused himself from taking
active part in the relief of Nam-han on the score of scarcity
of food. For this he was afterward banished.</p>

<p class='c000'>Singular events were happening in the north where
Gen. Yang Keun lay with a considerable force a short distance
north of Seoul. He was however a coward and dared
not move hand or foot. Two other generals felt that they
might get into trouble if they did do not something, and they
had the happy thought that they ought to report to their
superior, Gen. Yang Keun, for they knew he would do nothing,
and thus they would be safe, for their responsibility
would cease. So they went to him and urged him to advance
against the Manchus. But he declined to do so, and even
gave them a written statement to that effect. Armed with
that they felt quite safe. So there they lay a month till they
heard at last of the fall of Nam-han.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of another stamp was Gen. Yu Rim. He was on the
road between Seoul and P’yŭng-yang and, being attacked by
the Manchus, he and his little band defended themselves
with such good effect that the Manchu camp resounded all
night with wailings for their dead. The Koreans, finding
that their ammunition was almost exhausted, then planned
an ingenious retreat. Loading their muskets they tied them
to trees, attached fuses of different lengths and then silently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>retreated. The guns kept going off all night and so the
enemy knew nothing of the retreat until it was discovered in
the morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another effort that was made about this time was that of
Generals Kim Cha-jŭm and Yŏk-dal who had a following of
some 7,000 men. Starting from the north they came down to
the vicinity of Song-do. Unfortunately they had no scouts
out and suddenly falling in with a Manchu force in the narrow
passage a few miles beyond Song-do, they were thrown
into a panic and it is said that 5,000 men were killed, though
it seems almost incredible that only 2,000 men survived out of
7,000. Gen. Kim escaped by scaling the steep mountain side
but his second was caught and bound. The two thousand
survivors rallied and attacked the Manchus with such fury
that they were forced back and the captured general was rescued.
Gen. Kim Cha-jŭm then made his way to where Gen.
Yang Keun was idling away his time, and together they
awaited the surrender of the king. We may anticipate a few
months and say that after peace was made these two generals
were banished to distant places for their criminal
cowardice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gen. Sin Kyöng-wan, stationed at Ong-jin in Whang-hă
Province, was surrounded by the enemy, but the place was
so difficult of approach, owing to the roughness of the ground,
that they could not reduce it; so, hoping to draw out the garrison
they feigned retreat. Gen. Sin was not to be caught
thus, and sent out one of his lieutenants to reconnoitre.
That man happened to be just recovering from a wound, and
so he did not go far, but spent the night in a neighboring
inn. He came back in the morning and reported the enemy
gone. Gen. Sin then led out his troops to take them to the
vicinity of Seoul; but the Manchus, who were lying concealed
in the vicinity, rushed out upon him and captured him.
He was released only after peace had been declared.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Nam-han a severe mental struggle was going on.
They well knew that surrender and humiliation were inevitable
but their pride revolted at the thought, and each tried
to throw the blame on the other. This may be illustrated by
a single case which will show how mutual recriminations
were being made in the very presence of the siege-weary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>king. Yu Păk-jeung memorialized the king in these words:
“Gen. Kim Nyu who holds the rank of General-in-chief is a
man of no military skill, a man of jealous, vindictive temperament
and his house is full of bribes. When the king
came to Nam-han it was almost without retinue, but he, forsooth,
must bring sixty horsemen at his back. And the females
of his household came in litters. He it was who urged
the king to give up the crown prince to the tender mercies
of the Manchu wolves. He it was who compassed the humiliation
of the king by advising him to send that self-effacing
letter which, though so humble, was rejected. This is all the
work of Kim Nyu.” Here as elsewhere we see that personal
spite has <a id='corr112.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='alway'>always</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_112.13'>always</a></span> been the rock on which the interests of Korea
have been wrecked.</p>

<p class='c000'>The emperor knew that he had the king secure, and he
determined to delay the ratification of a treaty until his captive
was reduced to the last crust, in order to brand upon the
memory of all Koreans the indubitable fact of their vassalage
and to teach them a lesson that they should never forget.
And so the days slipped by.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the sixth of the moon Korean messengers succeeded
in getting through the Manchu lines and brought the king
letters from his two sons on the island of Kang-wha, but the
Manchus were aware of this and redoubled their diligence in
guarding the approaches, and so the king was completely cut
off from the outside. A few days later a costly joke was
played by the Korean Gen. Kim On-yun. He led a small
party outside the West Gate and soon returned with two
heads. The king praised him and gave him presents of silk.
The heads were raised on pikes, but behold, no blood came
from them. A soldier in the ranks cried out, “Why is my
brother killed twice?” The truth is that the General had beheaded
two corpses of Koreans whereby to obtain praise and
favor from the king. The king replaced the heads by those
of the general and his second.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the twelfth the king’s emissaries went into the Manchu
camp bearing a letter from the king. They were told
that a great Manchu general was about to arrive and that
they must come again the next day. The people in Nam-han
were in desperate straits. All who had advocated continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>resistance now urged surrender, excepting Kim Sang-hön and
Chong On, who said, “Not till every soldier is dead, and all the
common people as well, will it be time to think of giving in.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day the messengers presented themselves in
the Manchu camp as ordered. The general who received them
said, “You broke your former treaty with us. Are you prepared
to keep it if we make another?” The messengers beat
upon their breasts and cried, “It was our fault and not the
fault of the king. We are willing to prove this with our
lives.” “But why do you not come out and fight?” “We
are an insignificant power and how can we hope to cope with
you?” was the humble reply. The Manchu then broke the
seal of the king’s letter and read, “When we signed the former
treaty you were the elder brother and we the younger
brother. When a younger brother does wrong it is for the
older brother to correct him, but if it is done too severely a
principle of <a id='corr113.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='righteousnessss'>righteousness</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_113.17'>righteousness</a></span> is broken, and the Supreme Being
will be offended. We are dwellers in a corner of the sea.
We know nothing but books. We are no warriors. We are
weak and must bow before superior force. So we accept the
clemency of the Manchus, and we are now vassals and you
are our suzerain. When the Japanese invaded our land and
we were on the verge of destruction, China sent her hosts and
saved us. Our gratitude to them lives in the very fiber of
our bones. Even at the risk of incurring your anger we
could not bear to cast them off. If now the Manchu power
shows us kindness and goes back across the Yalu, our
gratitude toward them will be the same. We have been a
long time imprisoned here and we are tired and cramped.
If you consent to overlook our faults we will engage to treat
the Manchu power rightly. These sentiments are engraved
on our very hearts and we surrender <a id='corr113.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='ouselves'>ourselves</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_113.32'>ourselves</a></span> to the clemency
of the Manchu emperor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Food was now practically gone. The officials themselves
were put on half rations and even the king’s daily supply
was diminished by one third. At the very most there was
enough to last but twenty days more. At this time the Manchus
burned the buildings in connection with the royal tombs
outside the east Gate, and also those near Nam-han. The
smoke of the burning went up to heaven. These acts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>vandalism must have been a bitter drop in the cup that was
being put to the king’s lips. On the sixteenth Hong Sö-bong
again went to the Manchu camp and asked why no answer
was sent. The truth is that the Manchus had determined to
first send and reduce the Island of Kang-wha. They answered,
“Gen. Kong Yu-dŭk has gone with 70,000 men to take
Kang-wha. We must wait till he returns.” The next day
they sent the king an insulting letter saying, “Why do you
not come out and fight? We thought we would get at least
a little fight out of you. Have not your soldiers learned to
load and fire? China is your good friend; why does she not
send and help you? Now you are starving and yet you have
the impudence to talk about righteousness. Heaven helps the
good and punishes the evil. Those who trust us we aid,
those who oppose we decapitate. As we have become your
enemies you see us here in force. If you will come back to
your allegiance we will treat you as a brother. If you wish
to live, come out and surrender; if you will come out and
fight so much the better. Heaven will decide between us.”
This received from the Koreans, starving though they were,
the following memorable reply, “We will die and rot here in
our fortress before we will surrender thus. Then there will
be no one to answer your insulting summons.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On the eighteenth a Manchu general came near the South
Gate and demanded that the king should come out and surrender
or else come out and fight. The king thereupon sent
a letter to the Manchu headquarters saying that he wanted to
come out and surrender but that he did not dare to do so while
the Manchu soldiers were prowling about the wall. As the
king handed this letter to the messenger Kim Sang-hön snatched
it from the messenger’s hand and tore it in fragments
saying, “How can you bear to send such a letter. Heaven
will still favor us if we are patient, but if we send this we are
truly undone.” Then followed a scene in which the courtiers
almost came to blows. Ch’oe Myŭng-gil took the fragments
of the letter and pasted them together and the next day in
company with another general took it to the Manchus. They
were met with the gruff reply, “We do not want your letters.
We want your king to come out and surrender.” That night
the Manchus scaled the wall on the east side and a great panic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>followed, but Gen. Yi Keui-ch’uk, with a body of picked men
succeeded in driving back the enemy. On the twentieth an
answer was received from the emperor who said, “The
reason why we demand that you come out and surrender is that
we may have a visible proof of your sincerity. If we depart
now leaving you still king of Korea all will be well. Why
should I deceive you since I am conquering the whole world
besides? Need I use guile? I desire to punish only those who
advised you to cleave to China and prove untrue to us. Before
surrendering you must send those men bound to me. I
shall kill them but the rest of you will be safe. One thing is
certain. I will read no more of your letters.” When the king
saw this he cried, “I cannot send those men bound to him.”
In spite of the ominous closing words of the emperor’s letter
the king again wrote saying, “Korea to the worshipful, glorious,
puissant, merciful emperor, greeting. We are narrow
and provincial people and very deficient in manners but the
contrast between our present mental attitude and that of a
few months ago is surprising. Among our councillors some
argued one way and some argued another but now starvation
has brought us all to the same point and we know that we
must become subjects of the Manchu power. But since the
days of Silla there has never been seen such a thing as a king
going out from his fortress to surrender. We cannot do it in
that way. If you insist upon it you will soon have nothing
left but a fortress full of dead. I have signified my willingness
to surrender but if I should go out to you the people
would never again recognize me as king and anarchy will result.
I long ago banished the men who opposed the making
of peace with the Manchus, so I cannot send them to you, but
the emperor must now be gracious and forgive our mistake.”
When the Manchu general was about to send this scornfully
back Yi Hong-ju told him that it was written by the officials
and that nothing more was possible; and that if anyone suggested
to the king the advisability of coming out it would
mean instant death. But the Manchu drove them away in a
rage. One official named Chöng On violently opposed all these
attempts at securing a cessation of hostilities and said it would
be better to sit there and rot than to surrender. He urged
that the fighting be continued.</p>

<p class='c007'>We must leave the king and his court, facing starvation
on the one hand and the deep humiliation of surrender on the
other, and see how it fared with the people on Kang-wha.
This island had earned the reputation of being impregnable,
because of the failure of the Mongols to take it when the king
of Koryo found refuge there. Kim Kyŭng-jeung was the
commander of the garrison there and Im In-gu was second in
command. Chang Sin had charge of the naval defenses.
When the king sent the Crown Princess, the royal concubines,
the second and third princes and the aged officials
and their wives to Kang-wha a few days before his flight to
Nam-han they were under the escort of Gen. Kim Kyŭng-jeung,
who was also taking his wife and mother to the same
place for safety. It was a long cavalcade, stretching miles
along the road. Arriving at the ferry which was to take the
party across the narrow channel to the island, Gen. Kim deliberately
began by filling the boats with the members of his
own family and fifty horse-loads of furniture which they had
brought along, and the Princess and the other royal fugitives
had to wait. For two whole days the Crown Princess was
obliged to stay on the farther side in imminent danger of seizure
by the Manchus. At last she summoned Gen. Kim and
said, “Are not these boats the property of the king? Why
then do you use them only for your relatives and friends while
we wait here in danger?” As there was no possible excuse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>for his conduct he was obliged to accede to the demand, but
only just in time; for, though there were thousands of people
still waiting to cross, a foraging band of Manchus arrived on
the scene and the terrified multitude rushed headlong into the
water, “like leaves driven by the wind,” and multitudes were
drowned. Large store of government rice was lying at Kim-p’o
and Tong-jin, and as the Manchus had not as yet discovered
it, Gen. Kim was able to get it across to the island;
but no one excepting the members of his own family and following
were allowed to have any part of it. He had such
faith in the impregnability of Kang-wha that he set no guards
and spent his time in feasting and playing chess. Prince
Pong-im suggested that it would be well to keep a good lookout,
but the general replied sharply. “Who is in command of
this place, you or I?” This Gen. Kim was the son of Gen.
Kim Nyu who had charge of the defence of Nam-han and between
them they managed things about as they pleased. There
was a running fire of dispute between Gen Kim and the other
leaders on Kang-wha and anything but good order and concerted
action prevailed among the forces set for the defence
of the people there. The Manchus, although without boats,
had no intention to leave the island untaken, and so they
pulled down houses far and near and made rafts with the
timbers.</p>

<p class='c000'>As it was in the dead of winter there was much ice on
either bank of the estuary, and as the tide rises some thirty
feet there the crossing was a difficult feat, even though the
actual distance was small. Soon the message came from the
ferry guards that the Manchus had finished their rafts and
would soon be attempting the passage. Gen. Kim called them
fools for thinking the Manchus would dare to cross in the face
of such obstacles, but when it was announced that they had
actually embarked in their improvised craft he bestirred himself.
He sent a force under Yun Sin-ji to guard the upper
ferry, Yu Chŭng-nyang took charge of the middle ferry, Yu
Sŭng-jeung guarded the lower ferry and Yi Hyŭng was on
guard at Ma-ri-san, still lower down. Gen. Kim stationed
himself at the middle ferry. There was a great lack of arms,
but as there were plenty in the Kang-wha arsenal the soldiers
demanded them; but Gen. Kim refused. It was the intention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>of the Manchus to cross under fire of certain huge cannon
which they had planted on the opposite bank. When the shot
from these began kicking up the dust about Gen. Kim he
found he was urgently needed elsewhere and was hardly restrained
by the indignant outcry of his lieutenants. The
Manchus were then seen boarding their strange craft and in
the very fore front came a raft with seventeen men who held
shields in one hand while they paddled with the other. Admiral
Chang Sin was lower down with a fleet of boats and he made
desperate efforts to come to the place where this crossing was
taking place, but the tide which runs there like a mill-race
was against him and he could make no headway at all. He
simply stood in his boat and beat his breast with anger and
chagrin. Kang Sin-sŭk was farther up the estuary with other
boats and he hastened to come down; but it was too late. The
first raft full of Manchus had gained a foothold on the island.
The Koreans found their powder wet and the arrows exhausted.
As a consequence the whole force, numbering about two
hundred men, turned and fled before seventeen Manchus.
These men paced up and down the shore waiting for reinforcements,
for which they had signalled. Gen. Kim had already
fled in a small boat, which finally landed him far down the
coast. Then the whole Manchu army made its way across,
some on rafts and some in boats which were sent from the island.
The Crown Princess wanted to make her escape with
her little two year old boy, but the Manchu soldiers at the
gate of the fortress would not let her come out. She then
gave the boy to Kim In and he managed to get through the
lines and escape to the main land with the child, which he
took to Tang-jin in Ch’ung-ch’ŭng Province. The Princess
attempted suicide with a knife but did not succeed. The
Manchus called out to Minister Yun Pang and said, “We
will occupy the right side of the fortress and you and the royal
personages and other persons of high degree can occupy the
other side.” They then took all the common people outside
the North Gate of the fortress and set them in long lines.
These people were all wondering what was about to happen,
when out came a standard bearer carrying a red flag and behind
him came a soldier with a bared sword. Walking along
the lines they cut down every one of these innocent, unoffending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>people. The Manchus issued passes to the Koreans in
the fortress and no one could go in or out without showing his
credentials. All the people living in the vicinity who did not
run away were massacred.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having thoroughly subdued the island, the next move of
the victors was to rejoin the main army encamped before
Nam-han. As a preparatory measure they burned all the
government buildings on the island and put to death all the
people they could find, that had not already perished. Then
taking the Crown Princess and her retinue, and all the officials,
they crossed the ferry and marched toward Nam-han.
The Princess was treated with all deference, as befitted her
exalted station. As the company was about to leave the
fortress of Kang-wha on their way to Nam-han, the aged
Minister Kim Sang-yong was so deeply moved that he determined
to end his life. He entered the pavilion above the
South Gate where he found a box containing powder. Yun
Pang also accompanied him, saying that he too was weary of
life, but Minister Kim said to him, “You are in charge of the
ancestral tablets, you must not prove recreant to that sacred
trust.” So Yun Pang sadly went about that task. Divesting
himself of his outer garments the Minister gave them to an
attendant and told him to bury them in place of his body.
Then lighting his pipe with flint and steel he thrust it into
the box of powder. The explosion which followed blew the
whole gate to fragments and Minister Kim Sang-yong and
Kim Ik-kyŭm and Kwŭn Sun-jang and the minister’s little
grandson, thirteen years old, were blown to atoms. In order
to convey the ancestral tablets in safety to Nam-han, Yun
Pang put them in a bag, but the Manchus, who did not care
to be burdened with such impedimenta, threw the whole thing
into a ditch. Yun recovered them and cleaned them off as well
as he could, and managed to carry them along. Perhaps it
was only because the Manchus wished to show an indignity
toward these most sacred of all the royal treasures. The
following are the names of the most noted men killed in the
taking of Kang-wha. Sim Hyŭn, Yi Sang-gil, Yi Si-jik,
Song Si-hyŭng, Yun Chŭn, Chöng Păk-hyŭng, Kim Su-nam,
Kang Wi-bing, Yi Ton-o, Yi Ka-sang, and the following
ladies of rank were killed: The wives of Sim Pyŭn, Yun Sŭn-gŏ,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Yi Sang-gyu, Han O-sang, Kwŏn Sun-jang, Yi Ton-o,
Hong Myŭng-il and the mother of Kim Kyŭng-jeung. These
people died, some by the sword, some by strangling and some
by drowning. There were darker crimes than murder too,
for the Manchus did not hesitate to seize and insult many
honorable women, and even to this day a slight taint clings
to one family of the nobility because the wife and daughter-in-law
were subjected to indignities than which death were
preferable. From among the women taken there, the daughter
of Whe Wŭn, a relative of the king, became sixth wife to
the <a id='corr120.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Mamchu'>Manchu</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_120.11'>Manchu</a></span> Emperor, but shortly afterward he gave her to
one of his favorites as a present. And so we leave this long
line of captives wending their way eastward, and find ourselves
again within the grim walls of Nam-han.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ravages of hunger were beginning to make the Manchu
proposition seem more feasible. The council came to the
conclusion that the men whom the Manchus demanded must
be bound and sent to their fate. When the Crown Prince
heard of this he said, “I have a son and several brothers and
there is no reason why I should not go myself.” Then Chöng
On said “I am the one who have most strenuously opposed
the Manchu claims. Let me go.” Kim Sang-hon exclaimed,
“Who opposed them more than I? I am surely the one to
send.” Yun Whang, Yun Chip and O Tal-ch’e all offered to
go and immolate themselves on the altar of Manchu vengeance.
While the council was going on many of the soldiers came
down from the wall and looked in at the doors and shouted,
“As the Manchus have demanded these men why do you not
send them rather than let us come thus to skin and bone?”
It was with difficulty that they were sent back to their places.
It was remarked that the soldiers under Gen. Yi Si-băk did not
participate in this unruly demonstration. That night at
nine o’clock a party of Manchus approached the West Gate
and one of them actually scaled the wall before the guard was
aware of it. He was speedily driven back with a battle-club,
and stones and other missiles were rained down upon the assaulting
party. Gen. Yi Si-băk was twice wounded but did
not make it known until the skirmish was over. At the
same time an assault was successfully warded off on the
eastern side by Gen. Sin Kyŭng-jin who, not content with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>simply driving off the attacking party, sallied out and killed
their leader and many of his followers.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><em>TORTURING A WITNESS.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The Manchus next tried to reduce the fortress by bombardment,
and it is said that the projectiles came over the wall with
such force as to bury themselves twenty inches in the earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the morning of the twenty-fifth the Manchus sounded
a parley at the West Gate and three of the officials accompanied
them to the camp of the enemy. There they were told,
“The Emperor is very angry because you do not surrender,
and has ordered the destruction of the kingdom. He is to
leave tomorrow and then you will have no opportunity to surrender,
though you should wish.” The bombardment was
renewed and many breaches were made in the wall and many
of the garrison were killed, but the survivors quickly piled
bags of sand in the breaches and poured water over them.
This instantly froze and made a good substitute for a wall.
But the soldiers were discouraged and came to the king in
crowds demanding that the men whom the Manchus had called
for be sent. It was evident that something must be done at
once, and Hong Sö-bong undertook another visit to the
enemy’s camp, where he said, “Tomorrow the Crown Prince
and the other men that you have demanded will come out to
you.” But they answered, “We do no want to see the Crown
Prince, but the king himself.” To emphasize this, letters
were shown proving that Kang-wha had fallen into Manchu
hands, and a letter was delivered to them from one of the captive
princes to the king. They were likewise told, “The
Crown Prince and one of his brothers must go to Manchuria
as hostages. The king must understand that there is nothing
to fear in coming out. The <a id='corr121.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='kingdon'>kingdom</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_121.30'>kingdom</a></span> will in that way be preserved.”
So they took the prince’s letter and wended their
way back to the fortress. When the letter was opened and
read a great cry of sorrow arose from the whole court. Someone
suggested that the Manchus were trying to deceive them,
but the king answered, “No, this is my son’s own hand,”
and he added, “As Kang-wha is taken of course the ancestral
tablets have been destroyed. There is then no longer any
need to delay our surrender.” As a preliminary to that final
act the king ordered that all documents in which the Manchus
were spoken of slightingly be collected and burned.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>The next day a letter from the king was taken to the
Manchu headquarters, wherein he said, “As the emperor is
about to return to the north, I must see him before he goes.
If not, harm will result. If evil befalls me in this step it
were better that I take a sword and end my life here. I pray
you make some way whereby I can surrender without endangering
my kingdom.” The messenger explained that the
king feared that the Manchu soldiers might fall upon him
when he came down from the fortress. The Manchu general
answered, “Wait till you get orders from me; then come down.”
Kim Sang-hön could not endure the thought of surrender and
so attempted to take his own life by hanging, but someone cut
him down. Chöng On likewise after an apostrophe to his
“frosty sword” plunged <a id='corr122.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='in'>it</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_122.13'>it</a></span> into his bowels, but the wound
did not prove fatal and the king had him well cared for.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the next day, the twenty-eighth, two men who had
most strenuously opposed the Manchus, O Tal-ch’e and Yun
Chip, were made ready to send to the Manchu camp to meet
their fate. Before setting out they were brought in before
the king who wept and <ins class='correction' title='said.'>said,</ins> “Is it possible that we have come
to this? I am ashamed to look you in the face.” But they
answered cheerfully, “There is no cause for mourning on our
account. It is our own fault.” The king then made them
sit while a eunuch brought wine and poured it out. <a id='corr122.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Thi'>This</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_122.24'>This</a></span>
was the greatest honor the king could show them. Then he
said, “I will see to it that your families are well cared for.”
Then they set out to meet their fate. The emperor was pleased
at this sign of submission and gave Ch’oe Myŭng-gil a fur
robe and a cup of wine. Calling the two men before him the
emperor asked them why they had always opposed the Manchu
rule. They answered that after so many centuries of
adherence to the Ming dynasty they found it impossible to
give it up or to advise to do so. The emperor then ordered
them to be loosed but to be kept in the camp under strict
surveillance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day Hong Sö-bong, Ch‘oe Myŭng-gil and Kim
Sin-guk repaired to the Manchu camp and said they had come
to complete arrangements for the surrender. They were told
that an altar had already been prepared at Song-p‘a and that
the ceremony must take place on the morrow. The Manchu
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>general said, “We have a special form of ceremony for surrender.
First, the one who surrenders is placed in a coffin;
but as this is rather humiliating we will waive it this time and
begin with the second article.” Ch‘oe asked, “Shall the king
come out in his royal robes?” “By no means. He must come
out dressed in blue.” This was because blue is the color corresponding
to east, and was therefore appropriate for Korea,
which has always been called the “East Country.” “Shall he
come out the South Gate?” was the next question asked.
“No, how can one who has done wrong come out the South
Gate? He must come by way of the West Gate. After the
surrender he will proceed to Seoul and he need fear no danger,
for we have recalled all our foraging parties and no one will
offer to molest him. We will send back all the Koreans that we
have taken to Manchuria and we will have a new royal seal
cut for the king.” That night the Manchu general Yonggolda
brought the king a letter from the emperor saying, “Are
you indeed afraid to obey the command to come out and surrender?
You may rest assured of your safety, and not only so
but I will make it to your great advantage to come. I will
put you back on your throne, I will forgive the past, I will
make a firm and binding agreement with you as between vassal
and suzerain. If you would have your son and your grandson
reign after you, you must receive a new seal of office from
us. You must stop sending embassies to China and you must
discard the Chinese calendar and adopt ours. The Crown
Prince, the Prime Minister and the latter’s son must go with
us as hostages. When you die I will send the Crown Prince
to rule in your stead. I am about to invade China and you
must give us boats and troops. I must first take the Island
of Ka-do and to this end you must furnish us fifty boats and
sailors to man them, and you must give us bows and arrows.
Before our troops leave this place you must feast them. Hereafter
you must observe the birthdays of the Manchu empress
and Crown Prince. You must treat our envoys exactly as
you have been accustomed to treat Chinese envoys. I will
send back across the Yalu all our Korean captives but you must
pay for them. Your people must intermarry with ours. You
must release and return all Manchu captives that you hold in
your border fortresses along the Tu-man River. As for commerce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>with Japan you may do as you please. I make no law
about that. You must build no more fortresses. Now, behold.
I lift you as it were from the very dead. I have recreated
your Kingdom. Do not forget my great kindness and mercy.
Beware of harboring guile in your heart. Every year you
must send tribute; one hundred ounces of gold, a thousand
ounces of silver, ten thousand bags of white rice, two thousand
pieces of silk, three hundred pieces of white grass-cloth,
ten thousand pieces of colored cotton, four hundred pieces of
fine linen, one thousand pieces of coarse linen, one thousand
quires of fine paper, one thousand quires of common paper,
two hundred bows made of sea-cow’s horns, twenty-six swords
the length of a man’s stature, four fine window screens, forty
mats with red flowers, twenty common swords, two hundred
pounds of dye-wood, ten pecks of black pepper, one thousand
packages of tea, one hundred tiger skins, one hundred deer
skins, four hundred otter skins, two hundred squirrel skins.
You will commence sending this tribute three years from now.
As I have taken one of the king’s relatives to wife I will remit
nine thousand of the bags of rice.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Such were the conditions on which the Manchus proposed
to give the kingdom of Korea a new lease of life. The demand
for tribute was so enormous that the Koreans never seem
to have taken it seriously, and they never once attempted to
fulfill more than the merest fraction of the demand.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was on the last day of the first moon of the year 1637
that at last, having exhausted all other means, having endured
the rigors of a winter siege in a fortress but half prepared
for the emergency, having seen his faithful soldiers die about
him from hunger and exposure, the king was driven to surrender
to the Manchu power. The day broke with a great
bank of fog enveloping everything. The West Gate of the
fortress swung open and the royal cavalcade appeared, bearing
manifest signs of the long confinement. The king and
Crown Prince, according to the directions of the victors, were
clad in blue. Behind them came the hollow-cheeked, but loyal,
soldiers who would have stayed and defended the walls to the
bitter end had the king but given the word. As the royal
party descended the winding road to the valley below, they
came upon long lines of heavy-armed Manchu cavalry drawn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>up on either side of the road. The king was startled, and
anxiously asked what it meant, but was told that it was simply
in honor of the coming of the king. Soon the party met
the two Manchu generals, Yonggolda and Mabuda. The king
dismounted and the proper salutations took place between
them. Then they sat down and went through a formal interchange
of civilities, seated so as to face east and west according
to the proper rule of etiquette. When these formalities
were completed, they escorted the king to the place where
anciently the town of Kwang-ju stood, at which point there
was a short pause. The king’s immediate staff consisted of
three ministers of state, five officials of the second rank, five
of the rank of royal scribe and one or two others. Besides
these there were only the Crown Prince and his tutor. In front,
and at a <a id='corr125.14'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='condsiderable'>considerable</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_125.14'>considerable</a></span> distance, was a raised platform covered
with a yellow silk awning, under which the emperor sat upon
a throne. In front were drawn up a company of trumpeters.
General Yonggolda and the king dismounted and the former
led the king toward the imperial dais. Upon reaching the
eastern entrance to the imperial presence they bowed three
times and struck the hand on the back of the head. Then they
entered and bowed on a mat before the emperor. The king
was then told to ascend the platform. The emperor sat facing
the south and the king sat on his left facing the west. To the
left of the king and also facing the west sat the emperor’s
three sons, and finally the king’s sons who had been brought
up from Kang-wha. Below the platform sat the Korean officials
and at a distance the common people. The emperor’s
gilded throne sat on a dais raised nine inches above the platform,
beneath a yellow silk umbrella and the “plume banner.”
The emperor sat twirling an arrow in his hand. A cup of tea
was handed the king. Then the emperor said to the Korean
Prime Minister through an interpreter “Now we are inmates of
one house, let us try our skill at archery.” The Minister answered,
perhaps with a shade of irony, “We know letters, but
we are not skilled in archery.” Food was brought in and
placed before the king, the same in quality and amount as that
placed before the emperor. Each drank three cups of wine and
then the food was carried away. This was simply a formality,
intended to put the king at his ease. A servant then brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>in the emperor’s dogs and with his own hand he cut meat and
threw it into the air for the animals to catch. Descending
from the platform the king had the pleasure of meeting the
Crown Princess. Their brief conversation was interrupted by
General Yonggolda who came up with a magnificent horse
sumptuously caparisoned, and with a splendid sable robe.
These he announced were a gift from the emperor, but at the
same time he asked why the king had not brought the royal
insignia that had been given by the Chinese emperor, that it
might be destroyed. The answer was that it had been lost at
the time of the making of the former treaty with the Manchus,
but that it would be hunted up and handed over to the Manchu
general. General Yonggolda also presented each of the
ministers about the king with a sable robe. At five o‘clock
in the afternoon, as night was coming on, the emperor gave
word that the king might proceed to Seoul. It will be remembered
that the Crown Prince and Princess, together with
Prince Pong-im, were to be taken away to Manchuria as hostages.
Before starting for Seoul the king bade them adieu and
then with a heavy heart turned toward his capital.</p>

<p class='c000'>The retinue that followed the king was so numerous
that when they came to the ferry at Song-p‘a and found there
were too few boats to convey them all, there was a disgraceful
scramble for first place, and the king was hustled and dragged
about in a most unbecoming manner. Finally the crossing
was effected and as the cavalcade proceeded toward Seoul
they saw the Manchu camps along the way crowded with
Korean women, some of whom were wailing as if their hearts
would break, while others were making merry over the
prospect of being carried away to the north.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Manchu soldiery had been ordered out of Seoul to
make room for the king and so the royal party found the way
blocked by an immense crowd of Manchu soldiers loaded down
with booty and leading hundreds of captives. As the king
passed by, these miserable beings cried out to him to save
them, but their captors urged them on with word and lash.
The crowd was so dense, and the out-going stream of men
pressed so closely against those entering, that many in the
king’s retinue were taken for captives and were seized and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>carried away. Even some men of noble blood were thus, in
the darkness and confusion, spirited away and never heard
of again.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was seven o’clock when the king entered the gate of
Seoul. The city was almost deserted. Dead men lay in
heaps along the streets. The houses on both sides of the
street were in ashes. All the poultry and pigs were gone and
only dogs remained, and these had been transformed into
wolves and were gorging themselves on the dead bodies
along the way. As the Ch‘ang-gyöng Palace was nearest the
East Gate the royal party went there to spend the night. All
night long, in spite of the Emperor’s orders, Manchu soldiers
scoured the streets, burning and pillaging and working their
terrible will for the last time on the deserted capital.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two days later the Manchu army was to start on its long
journey to the north and the king went three miles outside
the East Gate to bid adieu to the emperor, for it was determined
to pass around Seoul on the east and so strike northward.
It took thirteen days for the whole army to get on
the move. There were 120,000 men in all. Thirty thousand
of these were Mongols and they took the road to the east
through Ham-gyŭng Province and crossed the Tu-man River.
There were 70,000 Manchus and 20,000 Chinese from Liao-tung.
Generals Kong Yu-dŭk and Kyöng Myŭng-jung
with 20,000 men took boat at Yong-san and sailed north to
strike Ka-do Island.</p>

<p class='c000'>The day following that on which the king took leave of
the Emperor, the generals Yonggolda and Mabuda came to the
palace to confer with the king. The Minister Kim Nyu, as if
to anticipate them, said “The relation between us now is that
of son and father. We stand ready to fulfill our obligations
on that basis even though you ask for soldiers to help on the
invasion of China and the seizure of Nanking.” Hong Sö-bong
asked that in view of the scarcity of gold in Korea
part of the tribute be remitted, but it was not granted.
Kim Nyu’s daughter had been carried away captive to Manchuria
and he had plead with the two generals and the king
himself had aided him but without avail. He now offered a
thousand ounces of silver for her ransom. It was accepted
but the result was disastrous to others for it set a precedent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>and a like sum was asked for each of the high-born captives,
with the result that few of them were ever ransomed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Emperor’s ninth brother had charge of all the captives,
and on the fifth day of the second moon the crown
prince was allowed to go to the king to say farewell. He was
accompanied by a guard of six Manchus who cut the interview
very short and hurried him away to the camp outside
the East Gate. On the seventh the king and his court went
out to this camp to say good-bye, and the Manchus set out a
fine banquet, at which some of the Koreans ate greedily while
others would not touch a morsel. The next day the order
was given to start on the long march into Manchuria. The
royal hostages were accompanied by fifteen high officials.
The king and his court accompanied the party twenty <em>li</em> out,
as far as Chang-neung, where with many tears the final
separation took place.</p>

<p class='c000'>The work of reconstruction was now to be commenced,
and of course the first work was to punish those who had
proved unfaithful and to reward those who had proved loyal.
First Gen. Kim Cha-jŭm, who had lain so long at Yang-geun
and would not move to help the king, was banished and with
him Sim Keui-wŭn, Sin Kyöng-wan and the governor of
Kang-wŭn Province who had hesitated to throw away their
lives and those of their men in the perfectly hopeless task of
breaking up the siege of Nam-han. Admiral Chang Sin, who
had been prevented by the swift outflowing tide from opposing
the crossing of the Manchus to Kang-wha was killed by
strangulation outside the Little West Gate. Kim Chyŭng-jeung
who had been in command of Kang-wha, and his lieutenant
Yi Min-gu were both banished to distant points. The
king gave a great feast at Mo-wha-gwan to those who had aided
him while besieged, both nobleman and common soldier.
The four most prominent generals each received the gift of a
horse. All the courtiers were advanced one step in the ladder
of officialdom. Other gifts and positions were distributed.
Those who had deserted the royal party when on that hard
ride to Nam-han were seized and imprisoned. Sim Chip, who
had refused to lie about his companion who went to the Manchu
camp to personate the king’s brother, was banished to a
distant point. Kim Sang-hön had fled to the country when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>the king came out of Nam-han to surrender. Being now included
in those who received marks of royal favor, he wrote
declaring that the could not receive them, for in the first place
he had urged the king not to surrender and in the second
place had run away and had also torn to pieces the letter
written by the king. “But,” he added “though weak and
forced to surrender, the king must always keep these things
in mind and seek for means to be avenged on the Manchus.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The king had sent Generals Yu Rim and Im Kyöng-ŭp
to aid in the taking of Ka-do Island in the north. In the third
moon Gen. Mabuda took fifty boats and crossed over from the
mainland to the west side of these islands, which the Chinese
garrison had left unprotected. Landing his force he ascended
at night a hill to the rear of the Chinese camp. With the
morning dawn he made a sudden and fierce attack. Meanwhile
the Korean general Im Kyöng-ŭp had arrived with forty
boats and had disembarked on the eastern shore. The Chinese,
thrown into confusion, rushed down to the shore and tumbled
into these forty boats that they found unguarded. But the
crowd was so great that only a small fraction could be accommodated.
As a consequence they swamped most of the boats
and hundreds perished. The Chinese commander, seeing that
all was lost, committed suicide. There were still great numbers
of Chinese among the mountains fighting desperately.
These were all cut down. It is said that in this short campaign
between forty and fifty thousand Chinese were killed.
During the unequal battle the Chinese kept calling out, “What
cause for enmity is there between Korea and China?” This
was of course addressed to the Koreans who fought with the
Manchus. After the battle the Manchu general Kong Yu-dŭk
gave generals Im and Yu a present of 250 Chinese captives,
but the former said, “I do not care for these men. Exchange
them for a like number of Korean captives who are going into
Manchuria as slaves.” This was done, and Gen. Im’s name
has come down to posterity fragrant with the odor of this
unselfish deed.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was during the year 1637 that the stone tablet was set
up beside the road to Nam-han, commemorating the Manchu
victory. It had been sent thither by the Emperor, but was
not immediately set up. A Manchu envoy came to superintend
its erection. It is said that there were two stones, one
of which was set up; the other, remaining on the bank of the
river, was finally washed into the stream. The envoy announced
that he had come to erect the monument at the point
where the surrender had taken place. A solid foundation
was built, with an ascent of several steps. The stone was
put in place and over it a pavilion was built to protect it from
the weather. On one side the inscription was in Chinese and
on the other side in Manchu. The inscription is as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Emperor Ch‘ung Té’ of the Great Ch‘ing Empire,
in the twelfth year of his reign, learned that we had broken
our treaty with him and he was angry. He gathered his forces
and entered our territory. He marched through it, for there
was none to say him nay. We, a weak and insignificant king,
fled perforce to Nam-han. Our fear was like that of one who
walks on ice in spring-time. We sojourned there fifty days.
Our soldiers from the east and south fled before the Emperor’s
troops. Those of the north and west hid among their mountains
and could lift neither hand not foot. Famine stared us
in the face. If the Emperor had stormed our fortress then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>we would have been like the leaves in autumn, or like hair
in flames. But the Emperor did not wish to destroy us. He
said ‘Come out and I will be your helper. If not I will destroy
you.’ <a id='corr131.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Generaals'>Generals</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_131.3'>Generals</a></span> Yonggoldă and Mabudă and other
great men were in constant communication with us. Our
councillors, civil and military, assembled, and we said
to them ‘For ten years have we been at peace, and
now we have been blind and foolish to bring all this
upon ourselves. Our people have become like meat or
fish beneath the chopping-knife. We alone are to blame for
it all’. The Emperor was patient and did not destroy us utterly
but told us to surrender. How could we refuse, for by
so doing we saved our people. All the courtiers were agreed.
With a score of horsemen we went forth from the fortress to
the Emperor’s camp and there confessed our faults. He
treated us with kindness and by his goodness calmed our
agitated minds. When we beheld him our heart went out to
him. The Emperor’s goodness extended even to our courtiers.
He then sent us back to the capital and recalled the Manchu
cavalry who were scouring the south. Our people, who had
been scattered like pheasants, now returned. All things became
as they had been. Snow and frost were gone and spring
smiled forth again. After the drought showers fell. All that
had been destroyed revived again. Things that had been
broken grew together. Here beside the Han at San-jun-do
where the great Emperor rested, here is the altar and the
enclosure. Here we, a weak king, through our Minister of
Public Works, have made the altar higher and broader than
before and have placed this monument to keep alive in the
minds of generations yet unborn the memory of these events,
to show that the goodness of the Emperor is as high as heaven
itself. Not that we alone have seen it, for all Manchuria as
well was witness to it. Throughout the world that gracious
voice cannot be resisted. Though we write with characters
as broad as the very earth and as clear as the sun and moon
we could never describe his greatness and his glory. For such
cause is it written here. Frost and dew are both from heaven.
One kills the other vivifies. Thus it is that the Emperor
shows goodness in the midst of terror. The Emperor came
with over 100,000 soldiers. Many of them were like the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>tiger and the dragon. Before them, brandishing their spears,
went the savages from the far north and the distant west.
Fearsome men! But the Emperor’s gracious words came down
in a letter in ten lines clear and beautiful, whereby our blinded
minds were enlightened. The Emperor’s words are luminous
and precise, and we, a small king, confessed and surrendered;
not so much because we feared his terror as because
we delighted in his graciousness. He treated us kindly,
paying all attention to the ceremonies and the rites. Then
we were glad and laughed, and every weapon sought its sheath.
Then we donned the garment of peace. The people of Seoul,
both men and women, burst into singing and said that the
Emperor had given us back to our palace. The Emperor pitied
the distress of the people and encouraged them to till the fields
again. To the dead roots of the tree was brought back spring-time.
This stone is lofty and it stands here at the head of the
river to show forth the Emperor’s goodness to the Sam-han.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Such was the statement that the Manchus put into the
mouth of Korea and until recent years they have claimed
Korea as their vassal state. The claim originally was perfectly
good. Never did a country make herself more abject
in her acceptance of a vassal’s position. And the only line of
argument that can be used to prove that that condition did not
hold till the treaty of Shimonoseki was signed in 1895, is in
China’s occasional disavowal of it, to shield herself from responsibility
for Korea’s acts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Japanese had been keeping watch of events that were
transpiring during these troublesome times, and at this juncture
an envoy came from the island empire announcing, as
between friends, the name of the new Japanese year. This
letter was not received by the king, who asked what use it
would be to him. The Japanese replied, “You have given up
China and are now a masterless dog. Why is our name not
good as any?” It shows how pride had been crushed out of
the Koreans to find that Ch‘oé Myŭng-gil himself said, “We
have done wrong to surrender to the Manchus. Now let us
make friendly advances toward Japan.” From that time on
it was customary to receive politely the annual message from
Japan, but there seems to have been no more <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rapport</span></em> between
the two countries than this.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>As the Manchu emperor passed north through P‘yŭng-an
province he gave orders to the prefect of Cheung-san to seize
and deliver up to him the person of Hong Ik-han who had
been especially virulent in his opposition to the Manchus. It
was done, and the man was carried captive to the Manchu
capital at Sim-yang (Mukden). There he was decently lodged
in a house of detention called the Pyŭl-gwan, until a certain
day when he was called before the emperor, who sat in
state surrounded by soldiery. Being asked why he had opposed
the Manchu influence he replied in writing. “All men
within the four seas are brothers but there can be but one
father. From the first the king of Korea acted uprightly and
mannerly. In Korea we have censors who chide and correct
him. Last year, being censor, I heard that you, who held to
us the relation of elder brother, had styled yourself emperor
and by so doing had ruptured the actual relations subsisting
between us. From the earliest times we have owed allegience
to China and how could we then advise the king to hold to a
false relation? This is the reason I advised the king to stand
out against you. This war and all its attendant miseries are
my work alone and I would that you might decapitate me ten
thousand times.” The emperor, who seems to have cherished
the idea that he had overawed the man, was thrown into a
great rage by this brave avowal and instantly threw the man
into a dismal dungeon where he doubtless starved to death,
for nothing more is heard of him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two men who had been delivered up by the king in
Nam-han were also carried north. They were also arraigned
before the dreaded chieftain Yonggoldă who attempted to
flatter them into making a complete surrender to the Manchus
and taking up their abode permanently in Manchuria; but they
utterly refused and asked to be killed at once. The Manchu
chief argued, urged and threatened, but the men were not to
be moved. Being ordered to execution they looked the chieftain
in the face and cursed him. Chöng No-gyŭng, an attendant
of the Crown Prince, begged for their bodies that he
might carry them back and bury them on Korean soil, but
the favor was not granted.</p>

<p class='c000'>That summer the people of Seoul and of the country immediately
to the south, were thrown into a panic by the antics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>of what they call ch‘ăk-ch‘ăk, a species of imp or demon which
appeared nightly in various places and terrified the people.
The Koreans are peculiarly subject to such hallucinations.
They said they were the spirits of those who had died at the
hands of the Manchus and the popular fears were not alleviated
until the king had ordered a monstrous sacrifice in their
behalf at two places near Nam-han, called Ma-heui-ch‘ŭn and
Sang-nyŭng.</p>

<p class='c000'>The king despatched an envoy to China in the ninth
moon to inform the Chinese emperor that he had been forced
to surrender, but he assured his former suzerain that the act
was by no means voluntary. To this the emperor replied in
a tone of commiseration, attaching no blame to the king’s enforced
allegiance to the Manchus. He himself was destined
ere long to feel the full weight of the Manchu arm.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have at this point an account of the first general use
of tobacco in Korea. It is stated that tobacco was first brought
to Japan by the Nam-man or “southern barbarians” and from
there was brought to Korea, thirty years before the date of
which we are now writing. It was first used by a man named
Chang Yu who was closely connected with the royal family,
being the father of a Crown Princess. It was called <em>tam-p‘agwe</em>
which is the Korean pronunciation of certain Chinese
characters which were used to translate into Chinese the Japanese
words for tobacco, which is <em>ta-ba-ko</em>. It is commonly
supposed that the Japanese took their word from the occidentals,
but we here have the word embedded in Korean history
back in the very first years of the seventeenth century before
it had even yet firmly established itself in European countries.
It seems almost incredible that the spread of its use should
have been so rapid as to have arrived in Korea within ten
years of the beginning of its common use in Europe, but it
may have been so. Portugese traders came in large numbers
to Japan and the fragrant weed was probably brought by
them. At the time of which we are writing, namely the end
of the Manchu invasion, its use had become common. It was
supposed to possess valuable peptic qualities and was recommended
especially to those who ate much meat. The Manchus
had become much addicted to the habit, but so many conflagrations
were the result that the Manchu emperor attempted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>to <a id='corr135.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='intedict'>interdict</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_135.1'>interdict</a></span> its use. It is needless to say that he failed. When
first introduced, it cost ten thousand cash for half a pound
but merchants obtained seed and it soon became common.</p>

<p class='c000'>In accordance with the demands of the Manchus, the
king sent 5,000 troops to accompany them in their invasion
of China, but as they arrived a month later than the set time
they were sent back home by the angry Manchus. Early in
the following year, however, Generals Yi Wan and Im Kyöng-ŭp
started with 5,000 troops and joined the Manchu army.
The plan was to attack Teung-nă on the Shantung promontory;
whether by land or sea is not clear, but probably by land.
This being known to the Koreans, three boats were secretly
despatched to the threatened place, giving warning of the attack,
and stating that the Koreans joined in the attack with
the Manchus because forced to do so. It was suggested that
whenever feasibly the Chinese and Korean forces should use
only blank charges against each other. This was gladly agreed
to and in a battle at Puk-sin-gu, which followed, not one man
was killed among the Chinese forces that were brought in
contact with the Korean contingent, and the latter suffered as
little. The Chinese general managed to get a letter to the
Koreans saying “The emperor reminds you of the vital aid he
gave Korea at the time of the Japanese invasion and he now
offers the half of his kingdom to anyone who will seize and
deliver to him the Manchu general in command.” This reveals
in a striking manner the desperate straits to which the
Chinese had been brought by the Manchus. The Korean generals
did not see their way to accede to this but they kept the
Chinese informed of every movement of the Manchus, where
they were weak and where they were strong, where they were
likely to attack and where they might be successfully attacked.
In this way the Manchus were continually thwarted and
the Chinese encouraged.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was proposed that there be a combined Manchu and
Korean attack upon Kon-ju-wi near the point of the Shantung
promontory, the Manchus to attack by land and the Koreans
by sea; but the latter said they had no provisions and their
boats were in very bad order. The Manchus replied “Then
you had better go home,” an injunction that they were by no
means loath to obey.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Meanwhile the king had been doing what he could to <a id='corr136.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='mitigated'>mitigate</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_136.1'>mitigate</a></span>
the sufferings consequent upon the invasion. He ordered
all the eight provinces to give rice to help the poor,
the widows and the orphans, and to provide proper burial for
those who had no near relatives who could afford the expense.
He likewise gave strong encouragement to the Confucian
School in the capital. He sent spies throughout the land to
discover whether the prefects were attending to their duties
well. Fearing that the guard along the Tu-man River might
be suffering, he made them a grant of 4,000 pieces of cotton.
He likewise gave money to repair the ancient altar on the top
of Ma-ri-san (Mountain) on the island of Kang-wha. This
altar is said to have been used by the Tan-gun two thousand
years before Christ, and may well be believed it to be the oldest
monument in Korea.</p>

<p class='c000'>This period of rest and recuperation was broken in upon
by the appearance, on the northern border, of Manchu troops
under Yonggoldă and Omokdo. Rumors had again reached
Manchuria that certain Korean officials had been advising
against the Manchu power. As a result of this, four prominent
officials were sent captive to the north. Early the following
year King Chilga, the emperor’s brother, came to try
these <a id='corr136.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='man'>men</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_136.23'>men</a></span>, and held a proper court at which the Korean
Crown Prince was present. Each of the accused men was
brought in turn and questioned, and each had some plausible
excuse to give. The result was sure from the beginning.
They were all condemned and were thrown into a dungeon
with a door in the top, a sort of Black Hole of Calcutta, where
they all languished with cold, hunger and disease. They even
excited the pity of their jailors, and when the Crown Prince
<a id='corr136.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>plead</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_136.31'>plead</a></span> for them before the emperor, they were ordered sent to
Eui-ju, but heavily guarded.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1640 the Japanese who had settled at Fusan complained
that the harbor was too small, for it did not include the
whole bay, but only that part directly in front of the settlement,
which was about half way between the present Japanese
town and the Korean town of Pu-san. The harbor was
called Tu-mo Harbor. Consent to the enlargement of the
harbor was refused.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1641 Prince Kwang-hă, the deposed and banished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>wretch, died on the island of Quelpart. So great is the respect
for royalty in the abstract, in Korea, that the king fasted four
days, had the body brought up to Yang-ju and buried it with
royal honors. To the one surviving daughter the king gave
a comfortable house and an annuity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next year a seditious movement was made by Ch‘oé
Hyo-il of P‘yŭng-an Province, and two accomplices. They
took boat for China, being provided with funds by the prefect
of Eui-ju. Arriving at Teung-nă they joined the Chinese
forces, received commissions in the Chinese army and despatched
a letter to the prefect of Eui-ju asking him to gather
a force and with them make a combined attack upon the Manchus.
As fate would have it the Manchu Yonggoldă was at
Eui-ju when this letter arrived, and it fell into his hands. He
immediately sent to the king demanding the seizure and execution
of all the men implicated in the plot. In spite of the
expostulations of the Prime Minister, who wished to see only
the prime movers punished, eleven men in Eui-ju and <a id='corr137.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='elsewere'>elsewhere</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_137.18'>elsewhere</a></span>
were seized and met their fate before the palace gate in
Seoul.</p>

<p class='c000'>That Japan and Korea had not forgotten each other is
evinced by the fact that the Japanese emperor sent to the king
asking him to suggest a name for an ancestral temple that he
was erecting. The king declined but allowed his uncle to do
it. The name suggested was “The Illustrious Place at Il-gwang
Mountain.”</p>

<p class='c000'>One more sacrifice was necessary before the last remnant
of opposition to the Manchus should be extinguished. It was
now six years since the surrender. Soon after that surrender
the king had sent to China explaining that it was a hard fate
and not his own inclination which had forced the surrender
from him. Not knowing whether the letter had ever reached
the Chinese capital he sent another letter two years later by
a monk, Tok-po, who had come from China to ascertain whether
Korea had really surrendered or not. Arriving at P’yŭng-yang
he had been received by Gen. Im Kyŭng-ŭp who sent
him on to <a id='corr137.37'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Choé'>Ch‘oé</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_137.37'>Ch‘oé</a></span> Myŭng-gil the Prime Minister. He was handsomely
treated and was provided with a new vessel and a
complete outfit of clothes and provisions for the return
journey. He carried a letter from the king stating his excuses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>as above narrated. Four years passed and at last in the
year under review the emperor’s answer was forwarded by
way of Chefoo. In it he <a id='corr138.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>exhonerates</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_138.3'>exhonerates</a></span> Korea from all blame
and mourns the fact that he cannot come to her aid as when
the Japanese invaded the peninsula. The bearer of this missive
was feasted and treated with the most flattering attentions
by the governor of P‘yŭng-an. This would have amounted
to nothing had it not been known to Yi Kyu the prefect of
Sŭn-ch‘ŭn who was carrying on trade with China by junk
across the Yellow Sea. He was seized by the Manchus and
carried north. Fearing the worst, he offered to tell his captors
an important secret as the price of his life. He thereupon
unfolded the whole transaction between Seoul and Nanking.
The Manchus were furious and sent a demand to the
king for the persons of <a id='corr138.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Choé'>Ch‘oé</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_138.15'>Ch‘oé</a></span> Myŭng-gil, Im Kyöng-ŭp, Yi
Kyöng-yo and Yi Myŭng-han, all leading men. There was
nothing to do but comply, and as these men went the king
wept and gave Ch‘oé Myŭng-gil 500 ounces of silver for traveling
expenses. Arriving at Pong-whang Fortress beyond the
Yalu they were taken in hand by Generals Yonggoldă and
Mabudă. Ch‘oé asserted strongly that he alone was to blame
for the whole transaction. When the emperor had looked
over the evidence he sent word that fines should be accepted
from the others, but that Ch‘oé be sent in a cangue and hand-cuffs
to Puk-kwan <a id='corr138.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>goal</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_138.26'>goal</a></span>. And there he leaves the stage of history,
on which he had played no mean part. The traitor Yi
Kyu plumed himself on his newly acquired Manchu citizenship
and presumed on his services to write the emperor a
memorial under twelve heads; but the emperor in fine contempt
exclaimed that a man who was not true to his own king
must be a rascal at heart and ordered him bound and sent back
to Korea where we may well believe the axe did its work
without delay.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next few years of the reign witnessed the return of
many captives taken by the Japanese during the years of the
invasion; they beheld the promulgation of the law that no one
could marry during the three years of mourning for a parent;
also a scourge of cholera so terrible as to cause the king to
send and sacrifice upon the eight high mountains of Korea.
A powerful conspiracy, led by the prime minister, Sim Keui-wŭn,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>came near overthrowing the dynasty, but the alarm was
given in the very nick of time and he and his fellow conspirators
were seized and executed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The twenty-first year of the reign, 1643, beheld the fall
of the Ming dynasty in China. The pretext given by the
Manchus for marching on Nanking was the revolt of Yi Cha-sung
who burned Nanking and drove the emperor to suicide.
Then, terrified at his own <a id='corr139.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='dead'>deed</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_139.8'>deed</a></span>, he fled and the Manchus
stepped in. When Nanking fell, a letter was despatched to
Korea <a id='corr139.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='saving'>saying</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_139.10'>saying</a></span> “I am the greatest of rulers. You have long
been my vassal and I will now show you a favor by returning
your hostage, the Crown Prince.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A word is necessary as to the fate of Im Kyöng-ŭp, one
of the men who had been sent to Manchuria with Ch‘oé
Myŭng-gil. He succeeded in making his escape before the
party reached the Yalu and in the disguise of a monk made
his way in a merchant boat to Teung-nă where he attached
himself to Gen. Whang Chong-ye and made himself very useful.
It is said that he made himself famous by capturing a
notorious pirate. He sailed straight for the island on which
the pirate had his headquarters and having gotten the pirate
and his crew drunk with wine he bound and brought them
safely to the Chinese camp. Later he fell into the hands of
the Manchus through treachery but was so steadfast in his
refusal to do obeisance to them that he excited their unbounded
admiration, and they let him go back to Korea. This
was an unfortunate move for him, for in the meantime Kim
Cha-jŭm had been recalled from banishment and had become
court favorite. As these men were deadly enemies the returning
general was immediately seized and put to death. This
same year saw the publication of the historical work named
the Tong-sa Po-byŭn.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the following year the Crown Prince and his brother
returned from China but the Crown Prince soon after sickened
and died. It had been customary heretofore for the
king and queen to assume mourning for three years for
a Crown Prince but now an innovation was made and
thirteen months was the limit set. Of course the succession
fell to the infant son of the dead prince, but, the
wife of prince Pong-im, the second son of the king, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>extremely ambitious to become queen, and so she went
about to gain the desired end. By every means in her
power she brought pressure to bear upon the king to induce
him to set aside the infant prince and nominate her husband
as heir to the throne. She was partially successful and the
following year the king called his courtiers together and consulted
as to the advisability of the plan. He urged that the
real heir was but a babe in arms and that he himself was old
and about to go the way of all the earth. It was evident that
he desired to put Prince Pong-im on the throne, and a very
animated discussion followed. Most of the leading ministers
and officials argued against the plan saying that it was contrary
to the best traditions of the land and that the people all looked
to the young prince as their future ruler. To all these
arguments the king opposed counter arguments which revealed
plainly that he had already made up his mind as to
his course, and that he was merely seeking for confirmation
of his views. Kim Nyu then said, “If the king has already
made up his mind let him speak out and put an end to this
useless discussion.” The king then announced that Prince
Pong-im was to be his successor.</p>

<p class='c000'>About this time a dangerous rebellion broke out in Kong-ju
the capital of Ch‘ung-ch‘ŭng Province, but by the prompt
action of the troops from the South it was put down. This is
worthy of mention only as it illustrates a curious custom in
Korea. On account of this rebellion the name of Kong ju
was for many years changed to Kong-san and the province of
Ch‘ung-ch‘ŭng to that of Hong-ch’ŭng.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince Pong-im, though now by royal edict in full
view of the throne, feared that by some turn of fortune’s wheel
he might fall short of that goal and so he much desired to
have the infant prince and his mother taken from his path.
The aged king had entered upon a period of mental semi-decrepitude
and was easily managed by the wife of Prince
Pong-im. Six palace women were accused of poisoning the
king’s food and were summarily put to death. The king
then summoned the courtiers and accused the wife of the
deceased Crown Prince of having assumed the garments of
royalty while in Manchuria, of having used disrespectful
language to him on her return and of having instigated the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>palace women to poison him. He said she must be killed.
All agreed that some positive proof of guilt must be produced
but the king insisted upon her immediate execution which
was accomplished by the use of poison. Her two brothers
were likewise beaten to death. Three of the leading men who
had advised against the nomination of Prince Pong-im were
also banished.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next year passed quietly, but the official corruption
had become so prevalent and the people were ground
down by the prefects to such an extent that the king made
the law that each prefect must have three bondsmen who
would be liable to punishment in case of his malfeasance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next year saw the introduction on the field of politics
of a noted man, Song Si-ryŭl, who was destined to be a leading
spirit for many a year. He was a celebrated scholar and
the king induced him to come to Seoul only after repeated
invitation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The very last year of his life this king cherished a bitter
enmity toward the Manchu power and in the twenty-seventh
year of his reign, selecting generals and planning to equip
an army, he hoped to throw off the hated yoke; but it was
not to be, for in the early summer of 1649 the aged monarch
breathed his last and the heir assumed the reins of power.
He is known in history as Hyo-jŭng Ta-wang.</p>

<p class='c000'>The accession of a new king was the signal for the combined
attack of all the officials upon Kim Cha-jŭm who had
been so long the practical autocrat. He was deposed, but
the king would not have him executed, because of his former
services. Song Si-ryŭl also took offense at the king because of
a supposed slight and departed to the country in anger, after
publishing three accusations against him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reign began with a storm. Kim Cha-jŭm who had
retired to the country in disgrace, took advantage of the fact
that the Japanese had made a proposition to the prefect of
Tong-nă to come over and join the Koreans in an invasion of
China, and sent a detailed account of it to China, adding that
the Korean government was preparing for war and had
discarded the Manchu calendar. This news caused tremendous
excitement in China and the veteran generals Yonggoldă and
Mabudă were sent forward to the Yalu with a powerful force.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Six envoys were sent to Seoul one following the other at
intervals of only two days. These six arrived at Eui-ju,
stopped there and sent forward letters demanding what it all
meant. Of course this was like thunder from a clear sky to
the court at Seoul, and Minister Yi Kyöng-sŭk rode in person
to Eui-ju and met the envoys. He invited them to Seoul
and after a long discussion and a present of a thousand ounces
of silver and the promise of a princess to go to China to wed
one of the Manchu princes and the banishment of a few of the
officials, it was found that no blame was attached to the king.
Thus began an eventful reign of ten years. The first years
were signalized by severe famines in the north and the government
had to bring large quantities of grain from the south
to relieve the suffering. Corruption had crept even into
the system of examinations and it was found necessary to
preserve the incognito of the candidates by having each one
write his name on the margin of his examination paper and
than have this portion of the paper cut off through the middle
of a stamp so that at last when the papers were examined
and the successful ones selected, the writers’ names could
not be known until they had been matched on, and found
to fit.</p>

<p class='c000'>An unsuccessful attempt at rebellion was made by the
notorious Kim Cha-jŭm and Kim Sik, son-in-law to the late
king. They persuaded the latter’s wife to place a fetich
under the floor of the king’s sleeping apartment. This is
supposed to bring about the speedy death of the person so
cursed, but someone found it out and divulged the plan. The
three leaders were beheaded, the woman poisoned and her
brothers banished. Some wanted the king to move because
the palace had been defiled by the fetich, which consisted of a
dead rat with the king’s name written on its belly, but it was
voted down because it would tend to confirm the people in
their belief in this foolish superstition.</p>

<p class='c000'>This king inherited much of his father’s hatred of the
Manchu power and we find him building a palace at Kang-wha
and storing provisions there in case of a break in the
peaceful relations then existing. He instituted some useful
reforms also, forbidding the cruel practice of beating criminals
to death. He likewise legislated in the interests of the people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>when he forbade the exacting of rent for water drawn from
the government reservoirs for their rice fields.</p>

<p class='c000'>Twenty-two years before this, Kim Hyŭk, one of the envoys
to China, had there met a Westerner who is known in Korean
history as Tang-yak-măng. This was one of the Jesuit priests.
He came first to Canton as a missionary but his great
talents were recognized in Nanking and the emperor called
him to the capital and questioned him about his religion, and
employed him as court astronomer. There the Koreans saw
the calendar called Si-hön-yŭk. When the Ming dynasty fell
the Manchus urged the Westerner to remain and they allowed
him a regular salary. Kim Hyŭk brought back a book from
Peking which is probably a copy or abstract of the celebrated
book above mentioned. For these twenty-two years a scholar,
Kim Sang-bŭm, had been studying this book, and at last having
mastered its secrets, he came out with a calendar of his own.
It is stated that the Westerners Yi Ma-du and Sa Su-sin had
already been many years in China when Kim Hyŭk visited
Nanking. (These are Ricci and Schaal).</p>

<p class='c000'>It was discovered that the country people were evading
the revenue laws by cultivating the hill sides above the margin
of cultivation set by law. Commissioners were sent out to
remeasure the taxable land and to set limits to hillside cultivation,
for it was feared that the cultivation of the hillsides
would diminish the fuel supply too much. It was in this same
year that the ill-fated sailing vessel Sparwehr sailed from
Holland with Hendrik Hamel as super-cargo. There seem to
have been sixty-four men on board, and when she went to
pieces on the island of Quelpart only thirty-six of them reached
shore in safety. They were taken to Seoul by the authorities
and for fourteen years lived, now on the royal bounty, now
by the work of their own hands, and at times they were even
compelled to beg for food. At last however the remnant of
them made good their escape by night and finally reached
Nagasaki. Hamel afterwards wrote an account of his <a id='corr143.35'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='capitvity'>captivity</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_143.35'>captivity</a></span>
in Korea.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1654 the hostility of the king toward his suzerain
took more definite shape. He appointed Yi Wan, a brilliant
young general, to have charge of all military matters,
and he sent military instructors all through the south where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>the great mass of the population lived, to drill the people in
the science of war. He likewise built fortresses at Sŭng-jin
in Ham-gyŭng Province and at Yi-bam-keum-sŭng and at
Kyŭk-p‘o in the south. He appointed four generals to be
stationed about Seoul to guard its approaches, and he collected
great quantities of grain, much of which he massed at
Wha-ryang near Chemulpo to be in readiness to ship to
Tientsin when he should invade China. He provisioned
Kang-wha thoroughly and built a monster store-house at
Chang-san in Whang-hă Province, because of the difficulty
experienced by the boats in rounding the exposed point of that
province; he founded a school for the training of military officers
and twenty of the best men were detailed for study
there. Any sign of indolence insured a prompt dismissal.</p>

<p class='c000'>This sovereign was an ardent advocate of dress reform.
At first he made the soldiers wear shorter sleeves and skirts
and for the sake of lightness they were often made of silk.
From that he made a more general application of his ideas.
He found the hats too broad of brim and the flowing sleeves
very inconvenient in the breeze. These points were ordered
to be changed and the palace hat as seen today was introduced.
It was first invented by the celebrated Chöng Mong-ju
whose blood still marks the stone bridge at Song-do. It was
he too that introduced the hyŭng-p‘ă or embroidered storks to
be worn on the breasts of civil officers, and the tigers to be
worn by military officers.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the tenth year of his reign, 1659, having exposed
himself to the sun and rain while sacrificing to heaven to secure
the cessation of a great famine that was on the land, the
king was taken ill, an <a id='corr145.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='abcess'>abscess</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_145.3'>abscess</a></span> broke out on his temple and
after a short illness he expired. In connection with his death
arose a contention that was destined to cause the death of many
men. The mother of the dead king was still living. She had
worn mourning for three years after the death of her elder son,
and now the question was whether she should assume it for an
equal length of time for this her second son. Song Si-ryŭl and
Song Chun-gil argued that one year only was sufficient. The
other side was taken by Yun Hyu and the debate was fierce and
long. The classics were ransacked for proof texts in support
of either contention. The Prime Minister decided in favor of
the shorter term and the Queen Mother wore mourning for
but a year. Song Si-ryŭl also laid up wrath against himself
by neglecting to have the king’s body wrapped tightly in
bandages, until it had swollen so that it required two planks
joined together to form the bottom of his coffin. This was
considered a great misfortune and ere a year had passed Song
was obliged to retire precipitately to the country to avoid <a id='corr145.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='beiog'>being</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_145.21'>being</a></span>
mobbed for the offense.</p>

<p class='c000'>The new king entered upon the duties of his exalted
position as a mere lad, in 1660. His posthumous title is
Hyon-jong Tă-wang. His first duty was to give his father
burial. The geomancers said he ought to be buried on a site
near the town of Su-wŭn, but the courtiers thought that was
too near the main road, so a place was selected outside the East
Gate. This first year was one of reform. The penalties for
murder were too small. If a high class man committed murder
he could get off with a hundred blows and ineligibility for
office for a short time, but now the king, with the advice of the
court, made all high class murderers permanently ineligible for
office. It must be borne in mind that the demarcation between
the upper and lower classes was much more distinct in
those days than it is at present.</p>

<p class='c000'>Looking carefully into the condition of things, the king
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>found many abuses that required correction. He ordered that
the army be better clothed; he examined into the cases of
many of the prisoners of state and liberated not a few; he remitted
the tax on hemp and ginseng in Ham-gyŭng Province;
he remitted the tax on the gold mines at Tan-ch‘ŭn which had
amounted to a thousand ounces a year; he lowered the land
tax in Ch’ung-ch’ŭng <ins class='correction' title='Province,'>Province.</ins> These voluntary retrenchments
called for economy at the capital and the king discontinued
the royal stables, to meet the falling off in revenue.</p>

<p class='c000'>A word is necessary here as to the complexion of the
political parties. The old Tong-in had gone to pieces and in
its place we find the Nam-in, the So-ron and the Sŭ-buk parties.

<p class='c000'>Among these the names of the Nam-in and No-ron were
the most prominent and their leaders, Hŭ Mok and Song Si-ryŭl
were deadly enemies of each other. There was no intermarriage
between these different parties. Each had its separate
color. The Nam-in was red, the So-ron blue, the No-ron
white and the Sŭ-buk black. It was not the men but the
women who wore these distinctive colors and even to this day
it is common to see the party colors in the collars of women’s
coats. The men were distinguished by the shape of the coat
collar. The No-rons and Nam-ins had a collar cut square at
the bottom; the So-rons had a bulging curve at the bottom and
the Sŭ-buk had a plain curve. These things sound childish
but in those days they meant life and death. The number of
men who have been sacrificed upon the altar of party strife
mounts up into the hundreds of thousands. The violent and
unreasonable strife between them prevented anything like
concerted action when the country was threatened from without.
They made it impossible for any man to be judged according
to his true merits. They effectually blocked the efforts put
forth by honest men to secure a clean and honest government.
There is nothing more despicable in political life than the
continued excitement of fierce passions when there is no principle
at stake and when personal aggrandisement is the only
goal.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>But at the time of which we write the No-ron party, with
Song Si-ryŭl at its head, was so overwhelmingly predominant
that party strife was for a time almost held in abeyance. The
remarkable character of this reign is largely due to his efforts.
The reign from beginning to end was one grand march of progress,
reform following reform with such rapidity that the
reign fairly scintillates with them. To realise how great a
part Song Si-ryŭl played in these movements it is necessary
to know the enormous power wielded by a Prime Minister in
Korea, especially when he enjoys the entire confidence of the
king. His power to keep the king informed or misinformed
makes him practically the ruler of the land. That Song Si-ryŭl
was a real reformer is shown by the frequency with
which, during many a decade after his death, statesmen would
break out in panegyrics on his memory. It is shown also in
the passionate hatred of political enemies who saw in him a
successful rival. We have little evidence that this man ever
lowered himself to the plane of common party politics. Let us
then review the fifteen years of this reign and see the stamp
of his great <a id='corr147.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='presonality'>personality</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_147.20'>personality</a></span> upon it.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have already mentioned some of the reforms inaugurated.
First he gained a signal victory over his rival <a id='corr147.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Hŏ Mok'>Hŭ Mok</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_147.22'>Hŭ Mok</a></span>
who tried to have him degraded because of his position in regard
to the period of the queen’s mourning. Song Si-ryŭl
went over the whole ground again, cited history in support of
his views and silenced by a simple and conclusive argument
the captious criticism of his detractors, but he showed his
greatness in not using his power to have his enemies killed, an
act of generosity which later cost him his life. The following
are some of the reforms instituted, and we give them here in
full, for they afford a deep insight into the condition of the
people.</p>

<p class='c000'>It had been very common for men to leave their families
and go off to some monastery and become monks. Now, the
Buddhist monasteries are the poor-houses of Korea. Beggary
is uncommon, but often, when a man has no visible means of
support, he will shave his head, don the garb of a monk and
spend part of the year at some monastery and the remainder
in receiving donations from the people in the shape of rice or
money. To do this they necessarily desert their families. To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>counteract this evil the king sent forth <a id='corr148.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='and'>an</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_148.1'>an</a></span> edict that no more
men with family ties should desert them in this way, and furthermore
that all monks who had families living should doff
their religious garb and come back to the world and support
their families like honest men.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <em>ajun</em> is a peculiar excrescence on the body politic of
Korea. He is the prefect’s clerk, or factor, or agent, or
pimp, or jack-of-all-trades. He is in a large sense the incarnation
of all his master’s vices, to which he adds many of
his own. A royal edict was promulgated which brought a
host of these men to justice and compelled them to disgorge
much of their <a id='corr148.12'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>illgotten</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_148.12'>illgotten</a></span> gains, which were given back, so far
as possible, to the people from whom they had been extorted.
In this case the reform was notable because of the limit which
was put to it. Ordinarily in Korea, when a man is caught
and made a public example of in this way, the law extends the
punishment to the near and remote relatives of the culprit,
and many innocent men suffer with the guilty; but in this case
only actual offenders were punished. It was strictly forbidden
to call to account any man’s relative because of his fault.</p>

<p class='c000'>For many years all the salt factories and fisheries had
been groaning under a heavy tax which went to support an
almost unlimited number of the king’s relatives; but now these
taxes were entirely remitted. We are not told what the relatives
did. Let us hope they went to work.</p>

<p class='c000'>It had become customary for the tax collectors to demand
a poll tax not only from grown men, who alone were taxable
according to law, but from children as well. This abuse was
likewise remedied.</p>

<p class='c000'>The king gave up entirely the wild project of assaulting
China, which had been a pet scheme of his father, and he likewise
found no cause for supporting such a large <a id='corr148.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='millitary'>military</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_148.32'>military</a></span> retinue
about his person, and they were discharged.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a flourishing Buddhist convent just west of
the Kyöng-bok Palace, in Chá-kol. The king wished to do
away with it, but some objected on the ground that it formed
an asylum for aged palace women, and because there were
many royal tablets stored there. We may well imagine the
consternation of these objectors when the king said concerning
the tablets, “Well, dig a hole and bury the whole lot.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>The useless custom of having masked dancers accompany
the royal procession when returning from the ancestral temple
was done away. The king put an end to the custom of taking
girls by force and compelling them to become palace women.
It must be only with the free consent of the girl’s
father. He consented to send men to various places where
sulphur was mined to see that the people of the surrounding
country were not ill-used. At the same time he ordered that
no more sulphur should be dug at Tal-sŭng-wi-gung inside the
South Gate. He ordered that the tombs of the king of Koryŭ
should be kept in good repair. He quelled a great popular
excitement in the south, which arose from the rumor that
various Buddhas in the monasteries were sweating, by showing
that it was caused by the frost bringing out the moisture
which had been absorbed during the rainy season. The rumor
was probably false, but how politic it was to take it for granted
and turn it off by giving some natural cause rather than
merely to deny the rumor. He added however the command
that as these Buddhas had caused such a disturbance they
must be burned.</p>

<p class='c000'>At that time the province of Chŭl-la contained about
190,855 <em>kyul</em> of land, a <em>kyul</em> being supposed to produce forty
bags of rice. The revenue was set at thirteen pecks of rice
from each <em>kyul</em>. The revenue from 24,084 <em>kyul</em> was set aside
for the support of the king’s relatives, royal grave-keepers
and for men whom the king particularly desired to honor because
of distinguished services. The revenue from the remaining
<a id='corr149.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='169771'>169,771</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_149.28'>169,771</a></span> <em>kyul</em>, amounted to 147,134 bags of rice, 69,280
of which came up to the capital and 85,916 were stored for use
by officials in the country. A certain amount of forest land
was customarily set aside for fuel supply for the different
palaces, but through maladministration these palaces each
had much more forest land that it was entitled to, and as a
consequence the people had to suffer. So the king ordered a
redistribution of the forest lands and a correction of the fuel
bill. He sent twenty bags of cotton seed into Ham-gyŭng
Province, for he desired to see this useful plant grown in every
one of the eight provinces. The island of Quelpart being still
very wild and the people uncultivated, the king, for the first
time in the history of the peninsula, made an attempt to civilize
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>them, by offering them government offices and by establishing
schools for them. He also did the same for the river
towns along the Yalu. As the wild tribes of Sŏl-han and
Pyŭl-hă frequently came across the border and looted the
people’s houses at and near Chang-jin, a general was sent to
take care of Korean interests. When 1403 scholars from the
country came to the capital and memorialized the king against
Song Si-ryŭl they were told that they were engaged in a mere
party strife and had not the interests of the country at heart,
and that if scholars meddled with the affairs of government
they would be severely handled. Along the Tuman River the
people were utterly ignorant, and scarcely knew whether there
was a king at all; so men were sent to found schools among
them and teach. Nepotism existed to such an extent, especially
in connection with the government examinations,
that the king decided that no relative of any of the examiners
should be a candidate for honors. He established a criminal
court in Seoul and took all criminal cases out of the hands of
the prefects, as they often judged from prejudice rather than
from the facts. He lessened by half the tax that had been
levied for the making of arms. The government seized all
common prostitutes and made them government slaves. Being
a devout Confucianist the king commanded that the names of
Confucius’ four disciples be never pronounced aloud. He
diminished the garrison of Su-wŭn from 6000 to 4000 on the
plea of economy. He gave presents of money to all unmarried
women over thirty years of age, as some compensation for
what, in Korea, is considered the hardest of hard lots. He
was so affected by distress which he saw in the country during
one of his frequent trips to the hot springs, that when he
returned to the capital he laid aside many of the luxuries both
of his wardrobe and his table. He made camps for the poor
who flocked to Seoul because of utter want in the east country.
One was outside the Water Mouth Gate, and the other
at A-o-gă. He likewise furnished them food and medicine.
When a boatload of Chinese belonging to the Ming dynasty,
which had fled southward, was driven by a storm on Quelpart
the king promptly forwarded them to Peking rather than lay
himself open to any possible charge of bad faith toward the
Manchu power.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>When some one tried to evade the payment of revenue
by claiming that the boat that was bringing it was wrecked,
he decided that if this happened again the owner should be
decapitated. The king restored the copper types which had
been destroyed at the time of the Japanese occupation of
Seoul. He built a shrine to the unfortunate Tan-jong Tă-wang.
He remeasured the lands in the southern provinces
for a proper adjustment of revenue. He decreed that though
a traitor’s family must be punished with him, married daughters
should be exempt from punishment. He acquiesced in
the suggestion of the minister of war that the scaling of the
city wall be made a capital offense, but when the courtiers
represented that if such a small crime deserved death everybody
would be a candidate for the executioner’s sword, he recalled
the edict.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of this king’s most interesting edicts was in connection
with the census. Having ordered a numbering of the
people, he found that objections were raised, because it would
mean a more systematic and thorough collection of taxes.
So he put forth the edict that whenever murder occurred, if
the murdered man’s name was not on the list of tax payers,
the murderer would be immediately pardoned. Of course
everybody hastened to get their names on the books and to
let it be known.</p>

<p class='c000'>He forbade marriage between people of the same family
name. A commission was appointed to go and break off the
point of dangerous rocks that obstructed the channels along
the coast and among the islands. No governor was allowed
to appoint any relative of his own to any position in the province.
A man who came up from the south and charged
Song Si-ryŭl with treason, but could give no evidence to substantiate
the charge, was put to death.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was customary to expose infants born of incest, and
they were allowed to die in the streets. The king ordered
that the government pay the expense of the rearing of such
unfortunates. He gave decent burial to those who died in
the mat sheds outside the wall, where contagious cases were
carried and left to die. He named nine kinds of men who
would make good prefects. (1) Men of good life and conduct.
(2) Good scholars. (3) Skillful men and those who fostered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>trade. (4) Natural leaders. (5) Fearless men. (6) Students
of human nature. (7) Men without an itching palm. (8)
Men renowned for filial piety. (9) Good authors.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the fifteenth year of his reign, 1674, he was taken
ill. The death of his mother worked upon his spirits and
aggravated his disease, and death ensued. He needs no encomiums
except the bare list of the great things that were
done during his reign. They will go down to posterity as his
lasting monument. His genius coupled with that of his great
adviser, Song Si-ryŭl, ranged through every phase of political
and social life, revenue, finance, political economy, agriculture,
mining, official rectitude, civil service, social ethics,
sanitation, education, internal improvement, the army, popular
superstition, slavery, penalties, foreign relations, border
police, famine relief, consanguineous marriage, publication;
these and many other important topics demanded and secured
from him careful attention. He put down party strife with a
heavy hand, and only once or twice during the whole period
of his reign does it raise its malignant <ins class='correction' title='head'>head.</ins></p>

<p class='c000'>His son succeeded to the throne, known by his posthumous
title Suk-jŏng Tă-wang. Party spirit had not been dead
but only in abeyance during his father’s strong reign. It
now broke out again. Memorials poured in upon the young
king urging the evil practices of Song Si-ryŭl, and the young
king thought there must be some truth in them because of
their very numbers. He became the center of a very storm
of charge and counter-charge, of attack and defense. Being
but fourteen years old and of a naturally vacillating temperament,
he was first the tool of one party and then of another.
His whole reign, which covered a period of forty-six years,
was one maelstrom of party strife and was fruitful of more
startling than useful events. His leading characteristic was
capriciousness. Again and again he turned from one party
to another, each turn being accompanied by numberless
deaths. But we must not anticipate.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be noticed that when his reign began in 1675 the
Nam-in party was in power with Hŭ Jŭk at its head. The
strife over Song Si-ryŭl had resulted in his banishment to
Wŭn-san. He was the Bismarck of Korea in that when his
master died the aged councillor found in the son the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>gratitude that the Iron Chancellor did. It would be an endless
as well as a fruitless task to describe the party fights that
took place. It will be enough to say that the reign was one
long fight from beginning to end. During the early part of
the reign, in 1677, a complete census of the country was made.
It was probably the conclusion of work begun by the former
king. It was found that in the whole country there were
1,234,512 houses, containing 4,703,505 people.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some excitement was caused when it was found that
Chinese histories were claiming that Prince Kwang-hă was a
good man, and that In-jo Tă-wang had revolted against him.
After a sharp party fight the king decided to send an envoy
and request the emperor to have the mistake corrected.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1678 the Japanese again insisted that their quarters
in Fusan be enlarged. Consent was given to move the settlement
seven <em>li</em> to the south, to the town of Cho-hyang. This
is the present site of the town of Fusan. From east to west
its length was 372 <em>tsubo</em> and 4 feet. From north to south it
was 256 <em>tsubo</em>. Two official reception halls were built, one
called the East Hall and the other the West Hall. The houses
were all built by Japanese carpenters from Tsushima and the
work covered a period of three years. The Korean government
gave 9000 bags of rice and 6000 ounces of silver to cover
the expense, and undertook to keep the place in repair. That
this colony was kept up in good style is shown by the fact
that Korea made repairs on these buildings in 1721, 1724,
1748, 1765, 1780, 1786, 1794, 1801, 1813, 1822, 1831, 1836,
1850, 1853, 1857, 1864.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most trivial matters were made occasions for party
fights. A storm occurred on a day when the king was to go
out, and the No-ron party claimed that it was a dispensation
of providence to spoil a plot of the Nam-ins to revolt and
seize the reins of power. Whoever took a firm position on
any point found later that it became the basis for an accusation
and a cause for death. So it was with the Prime Minister
Hŭ Jŭk who advised the building of a fortress near Song-do.
This later caused his death. The courtiers accused each
other in the royal presence about the most trivial matters,
such as quarrels between their concubines, the cutting of
fuel timber, the profligacy of the Prime Minister’s son, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>such like, while great matters of state seem to have taken
care of themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>And so we arrive at the year 1680. The Nam-in are
still in full power and Hŭ Jŭk is still master of the situation.
But see how small a thing accomplishes his downfall. The
day arrived for ancestral worship in Hŭ Jŭk’s house, but it
was very rainy. The king thoughtfully ordered the eunuchs
to get out the palace awning of oiled paper and carry it to the
Minister’s house and let him use it during the ceremony.
The eunuch replied that Hŭ Jŭk had already taken it. Instantly
the king’s kindly feeling was changed to anger and
hatred by the insolence of the Minister in thus appropriating
the awning. He sent a messenger and discovered that a
crowd of the adherents of the Nam-in party had congregated
at Hŭ Jŭk’s house. They were immediately denounced as
traitors. The generals were called and the house was surrounded
with troops. All the leading men in the Nam-in
party were killed on the spot. The names of the killed are
Hŭ Jŭk, Hŭ Kyŭn, Yu Hyŭk-yŭn, Yi Wŭn-jŭng, O Chŭng-ch’ang,
Yi T’ă-sö, Chöng Wŭn-no, Kang Man-ch’ŭl, Yi Wŭn-sŭng
and Yun Hyu. The king’s two cousins, Princes Pok-sun
and Pak-pyŭn, and eight others were banished. The No-ron
party were then called back to power. The king brought
back from exile the great Song Si ryŭl and also Kim Su-han,
whom he made Prime Minister. In twenty-four hours a trusted
minister and party were totally overthrown and every place
was filled with a member of the opposition. The next few
months were spent in hunting down the remaining leaders
of the Nam-in party and securing their execution. Some
were hung, some poisoned and some decapitated. One instance
of this will suffice. Hŭ Să and Hŭ Yŭng, two influential
men lived at Yong-san. There was no valid charge against
them, so Kim Sŭk-ju told the king he would find one. To
this end he sent one Kim Whan-go to Yong-san and gave him
money to build a fine house adjoining that of the prospective
victims. Before long he had them involved in treasonable
plans and as soon as enough evidence was collected the two
men were seized and put to death, and with them a large
number of their immediate friends. Man-hunting was not so
much a public necessity as a private pastime.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>The newly installed general-in-chief found great abuses
in the army and thousands of names on the rolls, of men long
since dead. Taxes were being collected in an utterly lawless
way. These abuses were done away and others probably as
bad or worse took their places, for as power meant spoils the
newly victorious party was not likely to forego any of its privileges.
We are borne out in this supposition by the fact
that about this time the king began the custom of making an
annual visit to the temple of heaven to pray for good crops.
This indicates that the people were being badly governed. He
paid considerable attention to the navy and appointed An-ju,
Suk-ch‘ŭn, Sun-an, Yöng-yu, Cheung-san, P’yŭng-yang,
Yong-yang, Kang sö, Sam-wha, Ham-jong and No-gang in
P‘yŭng-an Province and Chang-nyŭn, Eun-yul, P‘ung-ch‘ŭn,
Hŭ-sa and An-ak in Whang-hă Province to be naval stations.
It was only at this late date that the second king of the dynasty
received the posthumous title of Chöng-jong Tă-wang.</p>

<p class='c000'>Attention was paid to the border forts along the Yalu,
expenses were curtailed and garrisons were supported out of
the land tax of the adjoining districts. It was a time of many
severe calamities. A fire in P’yŭng-yang burned 344 houses
and a flood in Ham-gyŭng Province destroyed 906 more with
great loss of life. Song Si-ryŭl had not forgotten his old
master, now some ten years dead, and he suggested to the
king that Hyo-jong Tă-wang be honored with the <em>Se-sil</em>, that
is, that his tablet be not removed from the ancestral temple
after the fourth generation, as was customary, but should remain
there permanently. It caused a great commotion, but
the aged minister carried the day. It is true that few
monarchs of the line better deserved that honor than did Hyo-jong
Tă-wang.</p>

<p class='c000'>The year 1684 beheld a sort of “reign of terror.” It
arose in the following manner. A messenger from the Japanese
on Tsushima came post haste announcing that a large band
of Chinese pirates was about to land on Korean soil. A panic
followed in Seoul and thousands fled precipitately to the country.
Bands of thieves took advantage of the confusion to
commit many lawless acts. They formed a sort of secret
society and their principles were anarchistic. They made it
an object to raid houses where money was to be found. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>seized ladies as they were passing along the streets in covered
chairs, and violated them. They seized officials whom they
hated, and put them to death. The government found one of
their books and in it was written their oath of membership.
Three cardinal principles were set forth; (1) To kill as many
noblemen as possible, (2) To violate as many women as possible,
(3) To steal as much personal property as possible.
Seven men who had carried away and ravished a widow of
Kong-ju were caught and decapitated. One of them was her
own cousin and he belonged to the so-called “knife gang.”
After a time the disturbance was suppressed.</p>

<p class='c000'>One incident of a peculiarly Korean character deserves
mention. Some money was stolen from the strong room of a
fortress near Song-do. The store-house keeper was suspected
but there was no evidence. So the commandant secretly
questioned the keeper’s little son and found that the suspicion
was correct. The keeper was punished but the commandant
was also cashiered from the fact that he had induced a boy to
incriminate his own father.</p>

<p class='c000'>The native records say that in the twelfth year of this
sovereign, in 1686, Roman Catholicism entered Korea for the
first time. Certain foreigners entered the country and
preached the new doctrine. We are not told of what nationality
these men were but it was long before any European attempted
to enter Korea. We are told that the new doctrine
spread rapidly and that some of the highest officials asked the
king to send the foreigners out of the country. Whether this
was done cannot now be learned. Nothing is said of this in
the French work on the Roman Catholic Mission in Korea,
and it is somewhat difficult to understand. It would hardly
be found in the records, however, were there not some ground
for the statement.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>The following year beheld events that were to result in
another violent revolution and in the driving from the seat of
power the No-ron party and the reinstatement of the Nam-in.
It all grew from the king’s taking a concubine, Chang, who
soon gained complete ascendency over him. A rumor arose
that the queen was to be deposed and when Han Söng-u expostulated
with the king, the latter flew into a passion and
drove him away. The following year the concubine presented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>the king with a son, the most unfortunate thing that could
have happened, for, the queen being as yet childless, it served
to put the king more entirely under the influence of the concubine.
Trouble followed immediately. The king said “I am
now forty years old and have no son by the queen. The people
are getting uneasy. As I have gotten a son by a concubine
I intend to make him Crown Prince, and anyone may
object at his peril.” In this way he threw as it were a torch
into a powder magazine. The No-ron party who were in
power, were in arms at once for they knew that the opposition
had been using the concubine to undermine their influence.
Memorials poured in from all sides reminding the king that he
was still young, that there was no need of haste in appointing
the queen a successor. These memorials the king answered
by banishing the senders. Even Song Si-ryŭl who had entered
a mild protest, was stripped of rank and sent outside the city.
The Nam-in party then stepped once more into power. From
the Prime Minister down all offices were again turned over to
them. Song Si-ryŭl was banished to Quelpart, but the Nam-in
were not content with that, and demanded his death. So
he was summoned back to Seoul. Posthumous honors were
given to many of the Nam-ins whom the king had ordered
killed at the house of Hŭ Jŭk.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not long after this the king began to make preparations
to put away his queen. To this end he made the following
statement. “For a long time I have been aware of the queen’s
jealous disposition and evil mind, and I have borne with it
patiently but now I can endure it no longer. Since I have
taken the concubine Chang it has been still more unendurable.
The queen and the concubine Kim have been putting their
heads together in an attempt to frighten me into putting away
Chang, but I saw through the plan. Now what shall we do?”
Time and again the officials came pleading for the queen, but
the king was utterly deaf to all they had to say. He piled
unjust accusations upon her without deigning to give a single
proof. Large numbers where banished and a few killed outright
because of their intercessions with the king. The most notorious
case was that of Pak T‘ă-bo whose name has passed into
a proverb. He with two others memorialized the king begging
him to drive away the concubine and retain the queen.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>The king’s rage knew no bounds. He came out and took his
seat in front of the In-jŭng Gate of the Chang-dŭk Palace and
had the man brought before him. When asked why he had
written the memorial he answered, “Because of the treatment
the queen has received.” The king then ordered red hot
plates to be passed along his limbs. Still he would not express
sorrow. Then bowls were broken into small pieces and
the fragments were piled up on the mans already burned
limbs, a plank was placed across them and men stood on either
end of it and jumped up and down. The pieces of pottery
were of course ground into the man’s legs. As he still remained
firm he was tied with a rope and hoisted to the top of
a high pole in a cruelly painful position. As he still remained
unmoved he was banished to the south. His aged father accompanied
him as far as the river and there he died of his
wounds. This, so far from stopping the flood of petitions,
only increased it, for immediately 16,000 men with Chöng To-gyŭng
at their head sent in an appeal and likewise all the
country scholars and all the students of the Confucian school.
But every petition was returned by the passion-blinded king.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the fifth moon of the year, 1689, the king deposed the
queen, stripped her of all <a id='corr158.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='here'>her</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_158.22'>her</a></span> titles, degraded her to the level
of the common people and sent her back to her father’s house,
not by way of the great gate of the palace but by a side gate,
in a white sedan chair, the badge of a criminal. Concubine
Chang was proclaimed queen and her father became a prince.
We will remember that the aged Song Si-ryŭl had been ordered
back from Quelpart to meet his fate at the capital, but even
the popular sympathy which a public execution at Seoul would
have aroused was denied him, for the king sent a draught of
poison to be administered on the way, and so in an obscure
country village the grand old man drank the deadly potion
and passed away. Some of his followers who afterwards memorialized
the king in regard to him were killed or banished,
together with the deposed queen’s relatives. The following
year the son of the newly appointed queen was made Crown
Prince.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each year a large Chinese embassy visited Seoul, and it
was customary to feed them from silver dishes, which were
given them as presents when they returned to their own land.
This expense was met by a tax on the people of Song-do.
While the king was making a small tour in the country he
arrived at Song-do and there he asked about this tax. The
people replied that they had to sell their very children to
meet it, for it amounted to 1,200 bags of rice, 900,000 cash,
3,000 bags of other grain, 3,000 pieces of cloth as well as
other things. The king listened to their petition and remitted
the tax.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only five years elapse before we find the king making
another complete change in his household, by driving out the
new queen, who had been the concubine Chang, and reinstating
the old queen in her rightful place again. These sudden
and complete changes of face in the king would have been
amusing had they not been accompanied by the shedding of
so much innocent blood. The king had tired of his new
queen. He seems to have been one of those men who require
a periodical outbreak of some kind, but who in the intervals
are perfectly quiet. The time had come for such an outbreak
and Kim Ch‘un-t‘ăk was the instrument by which it was
brought about. He had bought himself into the good graces
of the palace women, and as a first step toward the accomplishment
of his plans he wrote a book in which was illustrated,
in romance form, the evils of putting away the true wife
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>for a concubine. The copy of this book which was given to
the king materially hastened the catastrophe. The Nam-in
were in power but they looked with concern upon the king’s
growing antipathy toward them and they urged him to put
the too bold novelist out of the way; but the leaders of the
No-ron party, knowing that all depended on a quick, decisive
blow, went in a body to the king at night and urged him to
follow the evident bent of his inclinations. This he proceeded
to do by banishing the brother of queen Chang, and with
him the leaders of the Nam-in party. Then once more the
No-ron stepped to the front and prepared to enjoy the good
things. High posthumous honors were given to Song Si-ryŭl
and to the deposed queen’s father and to many others of the
No-rons who had perished during the last outbreak. The
king, to save his “face,” called the deposed queen back little
by little. He first put her in a little palace in An-dong; then
he transferred her to the “Mulberry Palace,” and finally
brought her to the palace proper. The woman Chang was
again reduced to her former place and a stringent law was
made that henceforth no royal concubine should ever be raised
to the position of queen. The martyr Pak T‘ă-bo was
given posthumously the title of Prime Minister. The reinstated
party tried to induce the king to kill the concubine,
but, as she was the mother of the heir apparent to the throne,
he could not consent. A slave of this concubine’s resorted
to a clever trick in order to turn the tables on the No-ron party.
Enticing to his house a slave of one of the leaders of the No-ron
party, he got him intoxicated and then stole from him his
name tag, a piece of wood which each person was supposed
to carry and on which his name was written. This he took
and dropped beside the grave of the father of the <a id='corr160.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='conbubine'>concubine</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_160.31'>concubine</a></span>
where it was discovered that a fetich had been buried. This
was to show that a No-ron leader had resorted to the black
art to win back his way to power. The king, however, looked
into the matter, discovered the fraud and killed the prime
mover in the plot, a Nam-in leader. Many others were also
banished.</p>

<p class='c000'>Four years passed without any events of importance, and
then the queen became afflicted with boils and expired. The
records tell us that that night the king dreamed that the dead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>queen came to him with her garments covered with blood.
To his enquiries she made no answer except to point toward
the apartments of the concubine Chang. The king arose and
went in that direction, and his ears were greeted with the
sound of laughter and merriment. Wetting his finger in his
mouth he applied it to the paper window and soon made a
peep-hole. There he beheld the concubine and a large company
of sorceresses engaged in shooting arrows into an effigy
of the queen and making merry over having done her to death
by placing a fetich under her room. This was the signal for
another of the king’s periodical outbreaks. In spite of her
being the mother of the Crown Prince, he poisoned her and
killed all her sorceress companions. A host of the Nam-in
party also met their death. The almost incredible number of
1,700 people are said to have met their death as a result of this
disturbance. There must have been in connection with it a
sort of “star chamber,” or secret tribunal where many went
in but none came out, for we are told that a few years later
a secret prison in the palace was abolished.</p>

<p class='c000'>The year 1711 was marked by the building of the great
mountain fortress of Puk-han among the mountains immediately
behind Seoul. There had been a fortress there
in the ancient days of Păk-je. It is an almost ideal place
for a place of retreat, being surrounded with very steep
mountains.</p>

<p class='c000'>When this king died in 1720 the custom was first inaugurated
of having the whole people put on mourning clothes,
and wearing them for three years in honor of the dead king.</p>

<p class='c000'>The new king, known by his posthumous title of Kyöng-jong
Tă-wang, was the son of the disgraced and executed concubine
Chang. By this time the so-called Nam-in party had
practically passed off the stage of history; its leading men had
all been killed and it had left the field to its two great rivals
the No-ron and So-ron, although as we have before said the
No-ron was overwhelmingly predominant.</p>

<p class='c000'>King Kyöng-jong was a man of feeble intellect and he
took no interest in the affairs of government. He merely
served as a center about which factional fights went on. It
is said that his mother, the concubine Chang, when about to
be led to execution, said to him, “If I am to die you must die
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>with me,” and at that she struck at him with an improvised
weapon, a piece of wood. She succeeded only in wounding
him, but it was in a portion of the body that rendered it impossible
for him ever to have an heir. He swung like a pendulum
back and forth between the Noron and Soron parties,
agreeing with whichever happened for the moment to gain
his ear. This caused the Noron party some uneasiness and
they desired to see the reins of government in more responsible
hands. They warmly favored the king’s brother as a
candidate for the throne. The king was always ailing, for he
never thoroughly recovered from the wound which his mother
had inflicted, and he was unable to perform the ancestral
rites. He was also afflicted with sores on his head, so that for
months at a time he was unable to wear the headband which
is such a distinctive mark of the Korean. The Noron leaders
induced someone to memorialize the king asking him to make
his brother his heir. They all added their advice of the same
tenor, and finally induced him to consult the Queen Mother
about it. She entered heartily into the plan and the decree
went forth that the king’s brother was heir apparent. This
was like a thunder-bolt among the Soron ranks. The whole
transaction had been carefully concealed from them, and now
a man who could not, under the circumstances, be other than
a warm friend of the Noron party was heir to the throne, and
every Soron was in danger. They stormed and protested and
memorialized but to no avail. The appointment of an heir
was like the laws of the Medes and Persians, unalterable.
But the Noron people knew the weakness of the king and
they feared what might take place in some unguarded hour
when the enemy might get the king’s ear, and so they played
a bolder game still. They asked the king to resign in favor
of the heir. He promised to do so, but the unguarded hour
which the Norons feared came, and the promise was not kept.
Not only so, but when it was whispered in the king’s ear
that the Norons were trying to usurp the power the worst
fears of that party were realized. They were driven from
power and the Sorons came up smiling. But the king who
liked quiet and repose had one lucid interval when he said,
“There is no love of country in all this; it is simple party
prejudice and thirst for blood.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>At the head of the triumphant party were Cho T’ă gu,
Ch’oé Kyu-sŭ and Ch’oé Sŭk-hang. They began the performance
of their official duties by bribing the palace women
and eunuchs to kill the heir to the throne. The plan was to
shoot him “by mistake” while pretending to hunt for a white
fox which they said was haunting the palace. The heir was
informed however and took measures to insure his own safety.
He asked to have two of the palace women killed and two of
the eunuchs, but the king himself was in mortal fear of the
Sorons, whom he had brought back to power, and he dared
not do so. Thereupon the heir said “I will resign and go out
from the palace and become one of the common people.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Noron party were not idle. They knew that the
Sorons would soon be hunting their heads, and so they attempted
to take the offensive by assassinating the king; but,
as usually happened, they were betrayed, and terrible reprisals
followed. Twelve of the Noron leaders were beheaded and
hundreds were beaten to death or banished. It is gravely
stated that in this one connection eighteen hundred men lost
their lives.</p>

<p class='c000'>The close of the king’s second year witnessed a severe
famine on the island of Quelpart and the king sent thither
7,000 bags of grain and remitted the tax of horses, for which
that island has been from time immemorial celebrated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The desperate state of affairs at this juncture is well illustrated
by two incidents. First, the king was so enamored
of the Soron party that he took Mok Ho-ryong, their leader,
outside the gate one night and sacrificed a white horse and,
tasting its blood, swore that until time’s end Mok Ho-ryong’s
descendants should hold high office under the government.
Second, the Soron officials went to the shrine of the great
Song Si-ryŭl and tearing the tablet from its place, dragged it
through the filth of a dung-hill. Meanwhile we hear nothing
about the people and the country. The government was not
for them and they probably cared as little for it as it did for
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>But even these sanguinary scenes could not entirely stop
the march of enlightenment, for we learn that at this very time
foreign clocks, barometers and water-hose were being
brought into Korea from Peking where they had been introduced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>by foreigners. This was done by the envoy Yi
I-myŭng who met missionaries in Peking. He had a conversation
with them on the subject of religion and professed to find
great similarity between Christian doctrines and those of the
Chinese classics.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fourth year of this unfortunate king, <a id='corr164.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='1624'>1724</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_164.6'>1724</a></span>, opened
with a reform that augured well. It consisted in the destruction
of all the convents outside the city gates, especially outside
the West Gate which was at that time about half a mile
west of the present New Gate. The reasons are not specifically
given, but these convents had obviously become dangerous
to the morals of the people, and hot-beds of sedition. But
the king was not permitted to continue his reforms, for he
died in the eighth moon, of poison, it is said, administered in
a shrimp salad. It is further alleged that it was the work of
his brother, probably on the principle that he was the one to
gain most by the king’s death. But we may well doubt the
truth of the rumor, for nothing that is told of that brother
indicates that he would commit such an act, and in the second
place a man who will eat shrimps in mid-summer, that have
been brought thirty miles from the sea without ice might
expect to die. Of course all the Soron officials were willing
to believe the heir did it and one of them advised that a silver
knife be stuck into the king’s dead body, for it is popularly
believed that poison in the system will tarnish silver; but it
was not done. There was no way to prevent the hated heir
assuming his royal prerogative, which he did the same year, 1724.</p>

<p class='c000'>The new king, known by his posthumous title of Yŭng-jong
Tă-wang, now entered upon the longest and one of the
most brilliant reigns in the annals of the present dynasty; a
reign which proves, so far as circumstantial evidence can prove,
that he was not guilty of the murder of his brother. As may
be surmised, his deadly enemies, the Sorons, were driven from
office and the Norons reinstated. It is probable that the king
found it impossible to restrain the Norons from taking revenge
upon their enemies and we are told that a thousand
men were killed each year for some years. That this was done
in spite of the king, rather than by him, will be seen from the
strenuous efforts which he made to destroy the lines of party
demarcation.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>He began his reign with a statement of his inability to
rule the people rightly, and blaming himself for the sufferings
of the people from famine and plague. He immediately
proclaimed his son crown prince, so that from the very first
there might be no question as to the succession. He had to
give way to the importunities of his councillors and decapitate
Kim Il-gyŭng who had charged him with the murder of his
brother.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the very first day of the new year he proclaimed that
all party strife must cease; that men must think and plan for
the good of the whole country rather than for a particular
party. As he was returning one day from a royal tomb a
man beside the road shouted “There goes the man who poisoned
his predecessor with shrimps.” Recognizing in this
nothing but an attempt to keep open the old party sore, the
king handled the man severely together with certain others
of the Soron party who had instigated him to the outrage.</p>

<p class='c000'>From that day to this the Noron party has been uniformly
in power. Party strife practically ceased, not by the dissolution
of the other parties but because one party obtained
such an overwhelming ascendency that the others died of
starvation. Several things led to this result. A series of
unsuccessful conspiracies on the part of the Soron party,
each of which weakened it to the point of exhaustion; and
secondly the extreme length of the reign, during which, with
one short interval, the king held firmly to the Noron party.
The closing act of his first year was a reform which he forced
in the government dispensary. It had long been a rich
morsel for conscienceless officials to fatten upon, but now the
whole personnel of the institution was changed and it again
performed its normal function of dispensing medicines for
the public health. The king’s forbearance is seen in the fact
that when a thief was caught, bearing upon his person a
letter from two of the palace women asking him to procure for
them a deadly poison, the king executed the thief but refused
to proceed against the women, on the ground that they had
no possible cause for wishing his death.</p>

<p class='c000'>We here meet the curious statement, not mentioned heretofore,
that from the earliest times the Lords of Tsushima received
seals from the king of Korea. At this time the daimyo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>of that island sent and asked the king to renew the custom,
which had probably been discontinued for a short space of
time. The king complied with the request and had the
seal cut and sent. It is not possible to conclude from this
that the daimyo of Tsushima considered himself a vassal of
Korea, for it is not mentioned elsewhere in the Korean annals.
We can form but one theory that will account for it.
This seal may have been only for the purpose of identification
to vouch for the authenticity of letters that might pass between
Korea and Tsushima. The time may come when, in
the light of facts not yet discovered, this incident may throw
light on the early relations between Korea and Japan.</p>

<p class='c000'>A striking feature of this king’s reign was the promulgation
and enforcement of the principle of the prohibition of the
manufacture and use of spirituous liquors. We venture to
affirm that this king was the first in history, if not the only
one, to boldly assert and rigidly enforce the principle of total
abstinence from the use of wines and liquors. His three
commands were (1) Party strife must cease. (2) Luxury
must be curtailed. (3) The making, selling or drinking of
fermented wines or distilled liquors is a capital offense.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this and other reforms were about to be eclipsed by
the great upheaval of 1727, after the relation of which we
will return to them. The Norons made such desperate attempts
to induce the king to continue the persecution of the
Soron party that he underwent a revulsion of feeling and for
a short time punished the Norons by calling back into power
many of the opposition. It may be that this short respite
awoke the slumbering ambition of the Soron party so that
when they found it was but partial and temporary their
chagrin drove them into sedition. There appeared at Nam-wŭn
in Chŭl-la Province an insulting circular asserting that
the king had killed his brother and that the whole Noron
party were traitors. It called upon all good men to oppose
the government in every way possible. The governor sent a
copy to the king who simply said “Burn it up.” But he
greatly miscalculated the amount of sentiment that lay behind
that circular, and his enemies took advantage of his unsuspiciousness
to work up a wide-spread and powerful conspiracy
against the government. It was headed by Kim Yŭng-hă.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>This conspiracy was headed by the son of the executed Kim
Il-gyŭng, by Mok Si-ryŭng the brother of Mok Ho-ryŭng and
by the sons and other near relatives of the killed and banished
leaders of the Soron party. A large force was collected in
Kyŭng-sang Province and Yi In-jwa and Chöng Heui-ryang
were put in command. The conspiracy honeycombed the
whole country, for we are told that in P‘yŭng-an Province
Yi Sa-sŭng took charge of an insurrectionary force, while at
the capital Kim Chung-geui and Nam T‘ă-jung worked in its
interests. It was agreed that on the twentieth of the third
moon Seoul should be entered and that Prince Mil-wha be put
on the throne. But there was a weak point in this as in all
such ventures. One of the leaders in the south, An Pak, had
a friend living at Yong-ju, in the direct line of the approach
to Seoul and he warned him to move, as something was about
to happen. The friend coaxed him into telling him the whole
affair, and then brought the story straight to Seoul. This informer
was Choé Kyo-sŭ. Immediately the king sent out a
heavy guard to the river and also manned the wall of the
capital. Troops were thrown into Yang-sŭng, Chin-wi, Su-wŭn,
Yong-in, Chuk-san and Ch‘un-ch‘ŭn, and were told to
seize anyone who made the least disturbance. The brother of
An Pak being caught, he gave the details of the position of
the rebel troops and other important particulars. The king
appointed O Myŭng-hang of the Soron party as general-in-chief
of an expedition against the seditious people of the south.
He took with him 2,000 soldiers, but gathered more as he
proceeded south. Strong bodies of troops were also sent north
along the Peking road and to Puk-pawi outside the East Gate,
to guard the approaches to the city. In the south loyal troops
were in force at Mun-gyŭng Fortress near Cho-ryŭng Pass and
the governor of Whang-hă Province also took soldiers and stationed
himself at Whang-ju, near P’yŭng-yang. Others were
stationed in the defiles of the mountains just beyond Song-do.
It is quite evident from these extensive precautions that the
plot was a wide-spread and dangerous one and that it had
powerful leaders, not only in the country but at the capital
itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the south, the great rebel leader, Yi In-jwa, with banners
flying, led his powerful army northward to the town of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span><a id='corr168.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Chŭng-ju'>Chöng-ju</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_168.1'>Chöng-ju</a></span>. Here was stored a large amount of government
provisions and arms. It was taken not by storm but by
<a id='corr168.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>strategem</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_168.3'>strategem</a></span>. Arms were sent into the city on litters covered
with vegetables and other things and soldiers went in, disguised
as coolies. Once inside, they soon put the small garrison
out of the way and killed the commandant. Yi then
resumed the march on Seoul, appointing prefects in the districts
through which he passed and assuming the title “Great
General-in-Chief.” The claim was that the uprising was in
behalf of the dead king. All the soldiers were in mourning
for him and they carried in their ranks a shrine to his memory,
before which they offered sacrifices.</p>

<p class='c000'>The road from the south coming up to Seoul divides at
Mok-ch‘ŭn, one branch proceeding by way of Chik-san and
the other by An-sŭng, but they unite again at Su-wŭn. The
rebels arrived at Mok-ch‘ŭn just as the royal troops arrived at
Su-wŭn. It was of prime importance to the rebels to know by
which road the royal army, under O Myŭng hang, were coming.
Whichever way they came the rebels must take the
other road and so evade an action. Gen. O was astute enough
to surmise this but he did not propose to let the rebels steal a
march on him in this way; so he sent forward a small part of
his force toward Chik-san, but with the main body of his
troops he took the road by way of An-sung. His calculations
were correct, and when he neared An-sŭng he found that the
enemy were encamped there in fancied security. Taking a
picked band of 700 men Gen. O made a detour and came
around the hill on whose slope the rebels were encamped. In
the night he made a wild charge down from its summit into
the camp. The effect was instantaneous. A moment later
the whole rebel force was in full flight, racing for their lives,
while the pursuers cut them down at pleasure. Yi In-jwa was
captured and brought to Seoul. Meanwhile Pak P‘il-pön the
prefect of Sön-san opposed the remaining rebels in Kyŭng-sang
Province, capturing and killing a great number of them,
especially the leaders Ung Po and Heui Ryang, whose heads
he sent to Seoul in a box.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Gen O Myŭng-hang returned in triumph to Seoul
the king went out to meet him, and after the traitors’ heads
had been impaled on high, they all adjourned to the palace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>where a great feast was spread, at which the king gave Gen.
O a sounding title and to Ch‘oé Kyo-sŭ, who betrayed the plot
he gave the house near the present English Church, which
has in connection with it a memorial shrine. The king had a
book printed giving in details the evil deeds of the Soron
party. Since that time there have been no great party struggles.
Sacrifices were offered for all who had been killed by the
rebels. The king showed his clemency by liberating the five-year-old
son of one of the traitors. He had been imprisoned
according to the law of the country, to be kept until his
fifteenth year, and then he would be led out to execution.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hand in hand with the king’s prejudice against the use
of wine went a similar prejudice against mining, so that not
only did he peremptorily forbid the mining of silver at Au-byŭn
but hearing that copper was being mined near the same
place he sent and put a stop to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1727 the heir apparent died and was given the posthumous
title of Hyo-jang Se-ja. Two years later another
incipient rebellion broke out in the south having as its object
the placing of Ha Keui, a relative of the king, on the throne.
It is said that with him died several hundred more of the
doomed Soron party.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next thirty-two years were crowded full of reforms
and their mere enumeration throws much light on the social
and economic conditions of the time.</p>

<p class='c000'>A map was made of the northern boundary and a fortress
was built at Un-du; the law was promulgated that the
grandson of a slave woman should be free; on account of
drought the king ordered the making of numerous reservoirs
in which to store water for irrigation, and a commission was
appointed with headquarters at Seoul, under whose supervision
these reservoirs were built; the king had a new model of
the solar system made, to replace the one destroyed by the
Japanese during the invasion; at last China amended that
clause in her history which stated that Kwang-hă was a good
man and that In-jong Tă-wang had usurped the throne, and
the king presented one of the corrected copies at the ancestral
temple; the cruel form of torture, which consisted in tying
the ankles together and then twisting a stout stick between
the bones, was done away; a granary was built on the eastern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>coast, to be stocked with grain each year by the people of
Kyŭng-sang Province, for use in case of famine in the northern
province of Ham-gyŭng; the king claimed that the scarcity
of rice was due to the fact that so much of it was used in
the making of wine and again threatened to kill anyone who
should make, sell or use that beverage; in fact he placed
detectives all about Seoul, along the main roads, whose
business it was to smell of the breath of everyone whose face
or gait indicated indulgence in the flowing bowl!</p>

<p class='c000'>A boatload of men belonging to the overthrown Ming
dynasty appeared on the southern coast and asked aid in an
attempt to wrest again the scepter from the Manchus, but
they were politely refused; the king abolished that form of
punishment which consisted in applying red hot irons to the
limbs; he built the Chung-sŭng, or inner wall at P’yŭng-yang
in order to cut off the view of a <em>kyu-bong</em> or “spying peak,”
which in Korea is supposed to bring bad luck. Any place
from which may be seen the top of a mountain peak just
peeping above the summit of a nearer mountain is considered
unfit for a burial or building site.</p>

<p class='c000'>About the year 1733 famines were so frequent that the
king appointed a bureau of agriculture and appointed inspectors
for each of the provinces to help in securing good irrigation;
a man named Yi Keui-ha invented a war chariot with
swords or spears extending out from the hubs of the wheels
on either side. He was rewarded with a generalship. The
king established a special detective force differing from the
ordinary detective force in being more secret in its operations
and in holding greater powers. The rules for its guidance
were as follows, and they throw light upon existing conditions.</p>

<p class='c000'>(1) After careful investigation they may close up any
prefectural office and send the prefect to Seoul for trial.</p>

<p class='c000'>(2) This does not apply to prefectures where animals are
being reared for use in ancestral sacrifices.</p>

<p class='c000'>(3) In order to maintain their incognito they shall not
demand food for nothing at the country inns but shall pay
the regular prices.</p>

<p class='c000'>(4) For the same reason they shall not stop long in the
same place.</p>

<p class='c000'>(5) They must look sharply after the district constables
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>and thief-catchers and see that they are diligent and effective.</p>

<p class='c000'>(6) They must put a stop to the pernicious custom of
prefects’ servants taking money in advance from farmers as a
bribe to remit in part future government dues.</p>

<p class='c000'>(7) They shall prevent the sending in of incorrect estimates
of the area of taxable land.</p>

<p class='c000'>(8) They shall see to it that prefects do not receive extra
interest on government seed loaned to the people and payable
in the autumn after the crop is harvested.</p>

<p class='c000'>(9) They shall prevent prefects appropriating ginseng
which they confiscate from illegal sellers.</p>

<p class='c000'>(10) They shall prevent the king’s relatives and friends
seizing people’s land.</p>

<p class='c000'>(11) They shall stop the evil custom of prefects withholding
the certificate of release from pardoned exiles until they
have paid a certain sum of money.</p>

<p class='c000'>(12) They shall prevent the enlistment of too many men,
who thereby claim their living from the <a id='corr171.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='govenment'>government</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_171.18'>government</a></span> granaries.</p>

<p class='c000'>(13) They shall see to it that the prefects do not keep the
good cloth paid by the people for soldiers’ clothes, and hand
over to the soldiers a poorer quality.</p>

<p class='c000'>(14) They shall prevent creditors compounding interest
if a debtor fails to pay on time.</p>

<p class='c000'>(15) They shall stop the making of poor gun-powder and
of muskets with too small a bore.</p>

<p class='c000'>(16) They shall enforce the law that the grandson of a
slave is free.</p>

<p class='c000'>(17) They shall see to it that the prefects in P‘yŭng-an
Province do not receive revenue above the legal amount.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each of these specifications might be made the heading of
a long chapter in Korean history. We have here in epitome
the causes of Korea’s condition to-day.</p>

<p class='c000'>The governor of Kang-wŭn Province stated that on account
of the frequent famines he could not send three men
annually as heretofore to the island of Ul-leung (Dagelet), but
the king replied that as the Japanese had asked for that
island, it would be necessary to make the annual inspection
as heretofore.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1734 the king made his second son heir to
the throne; he did away with the punishment of men who sold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>goods in competition with the guilds or monopolies established
at Chong-no, the center of the capital. There had been so
many royal deaths that the people had become accustomed to
the use of white clothes, and had forgotten all other <a id='corr172.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>custom</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_172.4'>custom</a></span>.
But the king now declared that white was the worst of colors
because it soiled so easily, and he ordered the use of blue,
red or black, but giving the preference to the first as being
the color that corresponds with east. In the early years of
the dynasty King Se-jong had made a gauge of the size of
whipping rods. It was shaped like a gun barrel, and no one
was to be whipped with a rod that could not be put into this
gauge like a ramrod. The king revived this law and had
many gauges made and sent all about the country to the different
prefectures. He also forbade anyone but a properly
authorised official to administer a whipping, and he abrogated
the law by which thieves were branded by being struck in the
forehead and on each cheek with a great bunch of needles after
which ink was rubbed into the wounds. He next did
away with the clumsy three-decked war-vessels which were
slow and unseaworthy and in place of them substituted what
he called the “Sea Falcon Boat” which had sails extending
from the sides like wings, and which combined both speed and
safety. These he stationed all along the coast.</p>

<p class='c000'>While on a trip to Song-do the king paid a compliment to
the people of Pu-jo-gă, the ward in that city where dwell the
descendants of the men of the former dynasty, who do not
acknowledge the present dynasty, and thus show their loyalty
to their ancient master. At the same time he, for the first
time, inclosed in a fence the celebrated Sön-juk Bridge, where
still shows the blood of the murdered statesman Chöng Mong-ju.</p>

<p class='c000'>Since the days of King Se-jong, who determined the length
of the Korean yard-stick, that useful instrument had shrunken
in some measure and its length differed in different localities.
So now again the king gave strict orders about it and
required all yard-sticks to be made to conform to a pattern
which he gave. Previous to the days of King Myŭng-jong
men of the literary degrees dressed in red, but white had
gradually taken its place; and now the king ordered them to
go back to the good old custom. The official grade called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span><em>Halyim</em> became such an object of strife among the officials that
the king was constrained to abolish it, though it has since
been revived. Two of the emperors of the Sung dynasty in
China have their graves on Korean soil in the vicinity of Kap-san.
The duty of keeping these graves in order was now
placed in the hands of the governor of Ham-gyŭng Province.
The king anticipated the death of all party strife by setting up
a monument at the Song-gyun-gwan in memory thereof and he
ordered the people of different parties to intermarry and become
good friends. During the Manchu and Japanese invasions
all the musical instruments had been either destroyed
or stolen, and as yet they had not been wholly replaced, but
now there were found in a well at the palace a set of twenty-four
metal pendants which, when struck with a hammer, gave
four various musical notes. The inscriptions on them indicated
that they had come down from the time of King Se-jong.
This aroused the king’s interest and he set skillful men at
work making various instruments, notably a small chime of
bells to be used at the royal ancestral worship.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the year 1743 the king put roofs upon the West and
North-east Gates. Before that time they had been simply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>arches. He set on foot an agitation against the use of silk, and
ordered that no more banners be made of that material. He
utterly did away with the last remnant of the Soron party by
an edict in which he stated that all who would go by that
name were traitors. There was a popular superstition that
the third and sixth on the list of successful candidates at
the government examinations would soon die; so the examiners
were careful to substitute other names, in case a
friend or relative found himself in this awkward predicament.
The king happened to see this done once and upon inquiry
found that the names of two Song-do men were being substituted
in place of those of some friends of the examiners.
In anger he ordered the names to be all mixed up again, and
that each man be made to run his chance of sudden death.
One of his most salutary reforms was the doing away with
the <em>mudang</em> or sorceress class, who did and still do so
much to corrupt the morals and degrade the manners of the
Korean people. This period beheld the invention of the one-wheeled
chair, but its use was always confined to the third
official grade. A step backward was taken when it was
decreed that no one above the ninth official grade could
be beaten as punishment for crime. It tended to build up
another barrier between the upper and lower classes. And
yet it was not an unmixed evil, for a public beating must inevitably
lower the dignity of the office that the culprit holds.
There was such universal complaint against both the land and
the poll taxes that the king put it to vote at a plebiscite called
in Seoul in 1750, and the people voted unanimously for a
house tax instead, and the king complied. The next year a
grandson was born to him, who was destined to be his successor.
He found it necessary to police the four mountains
about Seoul to prevent the trees all being cut down. He
built for the first time a fortification at the Im-jin River. In
1751 famines in different localities drove crowds of people to
Seoul and the government was obliged to feed them; then the
king’s mother died; then the queen died. The king said
there must be some extraordinary cause for all these calamities.
He believed it was because wine was being secretly used in
the palace. It was denied, but he was incredulous and ordered
that even in the ancestral sacrifices the use of wine be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>dispensed with and that water be used instead. The provincial
general of Ham-gyŭng Province was convicted of having
used wine and the king went outside the South Gate to
see him executed. The culprit’s head was set on a pole in
view of the populace. Following up the good work of doing
away with sorcery, the king banished from Seoul all the blind
exorcists.</p>

<p class='c000'>The year 1753 was marked by two events of importance.
A woman created a great disturbance in Whang-hă Province
by claiming to be a Buddha and inciting the women everywhere
to burn up the ancestral shrines. The trouble ended
only when the king sent a special officer to seize and execute
her.</p>

<p class='c000'>We are told that by this time the secret study of the
tenets of Roman Catholicism had resulted in its wide diffusion
in the provinces of Whang-hă and Kang-wŭn. There was
uneasiness at court on account of the rumor that the people
were throwing away their ancestral tablets, and the king
ordered the governors of those provinces to put down the
growing sect. This was more easily ordered than done,
and as no deaths followed it is probable that the governors
did little beside threaten and denounce. Two years later a
work of importance was completed. The great sewer of the
city was quite inadequate to carry away the sewage of the
city and every time a heavy rain fell the sewer overflowed
and the street from the great bell to the East Gate became a
torrent. The king gave two million cash out of his private
purse and the sewer was properly cleaned out. He also appointed
a commission on sewerage and ordered that there be
a systematic cleaning out every three years.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have now arrived at the thirty-eighth year of the
reign, corresponding to the year 1761 A. D. Up to that time
the reign had been a brilliant one, not because of military successes
but because of social, economic and other reforms.
So far, it stands side by side with the reign of Suk-jong Tă-wang,
who with the aid of the illustrious Song Si-ryŭl, effected
such far-reaching reforms. We have yet seen but few signs
of that growing senility which forms such a marked characteristic
of the remainder of this reign. The king was now
over seventy years old and he had lost that vigor of mind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>which characterized the earlier years of his reign. But he
still possessed all that imperiousness of will which likewise
characterized him. Good judgment and will power should
decline together or else the results may be disastrous, as is
illustrated in the remaining years of his reign.</p>

<p class='c000'>We will remember that his first son had died and his
second son had been made heir to the throne. He in turn
had a son who was now eight years old. The evils which we
are about to relate grew out of the fact that the heir was not
as strongly attached to the Noron party as its adherents desired
and they feared that his accession might result in a resuscitation
of the defunct Soron party. The truth is the son carried
out in fact what his father commanded, but did not live up to—namely
the obliteration of all party lines. The old man,
while always preaching the breaking up of party clanishness,
remained a good Noron to the end of his days and the Norons
had all the good things in his gift. The king perhaps thought
that party lines had been lost sight of, but it was only the overwhelming
ascendency of the Noron <a id='corr176.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='pary'>party</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_176.19'>party</a></span>, which made comparison
absurd. Instead of destroying party lines he did
the very opposite in putting all the power into the hands of a
single party. This suspicion against the Crown Prince on
the part of the party in power was the main cause of the
disturbance which followed, but its immediate cause was the
ambition of a woman, a not unusual stumbling-block in the
path of empire. This woman was the sister of the Crown
Prince who desired that her husband be made king. Her
name was Princess Wha-whan Ong-ju. One of the palace women
also hated the Crown Prince. All these people desired
his removal from the field of action and all had different reasons.
The Noron <a id='corr176.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='rarty'>party</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_176.31'>party</a></span> wanted to save themselves; the
Princess wanted to become queen, and the palace woman wanted
revenge; why, we are not told.</p>

<p class='c000'>It did not take long to find a way. Hong Kye-heui, Hong
Pong-han and Kim Sang-no, three choice spirits came together
and began laying plans for the overthrow of the Crown Prince.
They first instructed the soldiers about the person of the
Prince to steal women or goods and, when questioned about
it, claim that it was at the order of the Prince. One day when
the king was taking a walk behind the palace he came across
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>a shallow excavation in the earth, covered with thatch.
Looking in, he found it filled with mourners’ clothes and
other objects of mourning. Inquiring what it meant, he was
told that the Crown Prince was impatient to have him die and
that he had prepared the mourners’ garments in advance.
This aroused the anger of the king. He never stopped to
think that it might be a trick against the Prince. Every
thing lent color to the suspicion. Again, one day, the king
found the palace woman, above mentioned, weeping bitterly.
She said it was because the Crown Prince had offered her indignity.
So by degrees plotters, bringing apparent evidence
from several sides, which could not but seem conclusive,
gradually estranged the king from his son and at last caused
the removal of the latter to another palace, the one called the
“Old Palace.” These things preyed upon the mind of the
Crown Prince and made him ill, but to add to this, it is said
they administered drugs to him which tended to unbalance
his mind and make him violent toward those about him. Then
the Princess his sister arranged a trip to P’yŭng-yang for his
health. It was intended that while he was there he should be
charged with plotting to bring a force to overthrow the king
and usurp the government. On his return, as he was approaching
the city near night, an official came in to the king
and announced that the Crown Prince was outside the gate
and intended to come in that night and seize the scepter.
This threw the king into a frenzy of rage. He immediately
had all the gates put under double guard and sent out demanding
the reason of the Prince’s treasonable actions. The latter
denied all treasonable intentions, but it was too late. The old
man was unable to reason calmly about the matter. On the
fifteenth day of the fifth moon the king went down to the
“Old Palace” to sit in judgment on his son. It was an
exceedingly hot day. When the Crown Prince came in
and bowed before his father, the latter said “Do you realize
how you have sinned?” The Prince replied that he was not
conscious of having sinned against his father in any way whatever.
As the king had already decided in his mind that the
Prince was guilty, this denial made him simply furious. He
screamed “If you do not die it will mean the destruction of
the dynasty. So die.” He then ordered all the assembled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>courtiers to bare their swords but they hesitated, for they
knew the Prince was innocent; but when the king leaped up
and drew his sword they had to do likewise. The Prince
calmly said “I am no criminal, but if I am to die it ought not
to be before the eyes of my father. Let me return to my
apartments and then do with me as you will.” The king was
too far gone with rage and excitement to care for the dignity
of his high station or to care for appearances. “No,” he
screamed, “It must be here before my eyes.” Thereupon the
Prince undid the girdle about his waist and proceeded to
strangle himself. The whole court were horrified, excepting
the king, who could no longer be called sane. They rushed
forward, undid the cord and dashed water in his face to bring
him back to consciousness, in spite of the king’s loudly vociferated
commands to the contrary. They joined with one
voice in asking the king’s clemency, but they might as well
have asked a maniac. He threatened to kill them too if they
persisted in thwarting him. He then ordered a heavy plank
box to be brought in and the Prince was commanded to get
into it. But at the moment he was trying to beat his brains
out against a stone and did not hear the command. One of
the officials ran to him and spread out his hands on the stone
and received the blows that were intended to end the life of
the unhappy Prince. Being dissuaded from this, the Prince
arose and went to his father and said “I am your only son,
father, and though I may have sinned, overlook it and forgive
me. You are not like my father now. You will recover from
this passion and lament it.” This enraged the king to such
an extent that he could hardly articulate as he ordered the
Prince to get into the box. At this moment they brought up
the little grandson to plead for his father’s life, but the king
raised his foot and gave the child a kick that sent it reeling
back into the arms of those who had brought it. It was evident
that there was nothing to be done; so the Prince proceeded
to climb into the box. It was now dark and when the
cover was nailed on it was not noticed that there was a large
knot-hole in one side of the box. One of the officials came
and spoke to the Prince through this hole. He was overcome
by the heat and asked for water and a fan, which were
passed in to him. One of those who were interested in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Prince’s death told the king what was going on, and he hurried
out and ordered a heavy plank nailed over the hole, and
banished the man who had helped the Prince. The assembly
broke up, but the Prince was left in this narrow prison day
after day to starve. Each day one of the palace servants gave
the box a heavy blow with a stone. At first it elicited an
angry protest from the Prince but the fourth day he only said
“I am very dizzy. Please leave me in peace.” On the seventh
day there was no response, and the servant bored a hole and
put in his hand and felt the cold body of the dead Prince. The
body was wrapped in grave-clothes and taken away for burial.
He received the posthumous name of Sa-do. It is a singular
fact that from that day to his end, some fifteen years later,
the king never expressed sorrow for this act of cruelty. It is
also significant that the Princess never tried to carry out her
plan of having her husband become king. The horror of this
scene seems to have turned her mind away from its purpose.
At any rate she drops from the page of history without being
given an opportunity to atone even in part for the terrible
crime for which she was largely to blame. The king still
looked upon his grandson as the heir to the throne, but he
made him disown his dead father and take his uncle as father.
He likewise made the boy solemnly promise never to change
his mind in this. We see from this that the king continued
to the very end to think that the Prince was guilty and his
deed justifiable.</p>

<p class='c000'>The year 1764 found an octogenarian on the throne.
From this time on, the king was exceedingly feeble, but he
clung to life with a tenacity that was amazing, and was destined
to encumber the throne for a full decade still. His increasing
weakness made it necessary for his physicians to
prescribe a little wine. He acquiesced, and from this time
the laws against the use of wine were relaxed somewhat. Its
use was soon resumed in connection with the ancestral worship,
but only at the importunity of the princess.</p>

<p class='c000'>These declining years are by no means barren of interesting
events. The annual sacrifice in behalf of the country had
always been made at Pi-băk Mountain in Ham-gyŭng Province,
but it was told the king that as Păk tu Mountain stood
at the head of the country and dominated the whole, as it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>were, the sacrifice should be made on or near that mountain,
So it was decreed that from that time on the sacrifice should
be performed at Un-ch‘on Mang-dŭk-p‘yŭng, eight <em>li</em> beyond
Kap san and in full view of the great Păk-tu-san or “Mountain
of the White Head.” And it was further decreed that
those who took part in the service should be secluded for four
days before the event, should bathe often and put on clean
clothes and forego all commerce with women.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1767 the king ordered a full census of the country. It
was found to contain 1,679,865 houses, containing 7,006,248
people. In other words there had been an increase of over
800,000 since the year 1657. He also ordered the making of
a new rain gauge. The first one is said to have been made by
King Se-jong. He did away with the punishment that consists
in beating the tops of the feet until, frequently, the toes
drop off. On account of the danger of ship wreck in rounding
the corner of Whang-hă Province the king ordered the
discontinuance of annual naval tactics at Chang-nyŭn, excepting
for the boats regularly stationed there. He built a
palace in Chŭn-ju in Chŭl-la Province and had sacrifices offered
there, for although Ham-gyŭng Province is said to be
the birthplace of the line, the family really originated in the
south. The king also revived the ancient custom of having
a bell hang in the palace gateway, to be struck by anyone who
had a grievance to lay before the king.</p>

<p class='c000'>A split occurred in the Noron party in the year 1771.
The two factions were called respectively the Si and the Pyŭk.
The former held that the father of the Crown Prince was an
innocent man and had been unjustly punished, while the
latter held the reverse. It is evident that those who claimed he
was innocent were making a bid for favor with the prospective
king.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the time of which we write the great sewer of the city
had a line of ancient willows extending the whole length.
This was found to be a disadvantage and they were hewn
down and the sewer was walled in as we see it today. Two
more factions arose about this time. They were called the
Nak and the Ho. Their differences were caused by conflicting
theories as to the interpretation of the Confucian classics.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>The greatest act of this king, and the one that casts the
greatest luster on his memory, was reserved for the twilight
of his reign. What led to it we are not told, but in the
eighty-ninth year of his life, by a single stroke of the brush,
he emancipated all the serfs in Korea. Up to this time all
the common people had been serfs of the <em>yang-bans</em> or noble
class. In every district and in every ward each man of the
common people owed allegiance to some local gentleman. It
took the form usually of a tax or tribute in kind and was very
loose in its application; but on occasion the master could call
upon all these people for service and he could even sell them
if he so desired. This is the reason why it is exceedingly rare
that a family removes permanently from any locality, at least
nominally. A man may go from place to place, or may live
permanently at the capital, but when asked where he lives he
will invariably name the exact spot where he originated and
where the seat of his family is still supposed to be. When
the common people were serfs they could not move at will,
and the custom became so ingrained in them that to this day
its effects are plainly seen. This aged king put forth
his hand and decreed that this serfdom should cease once
for all. It was different from slavery. That institution
still continued and has continued to the present day. This
serfdom included all the people who did not belong to
the so-called <em>yang-ban</em> class. It is quite plain that the
line of demarcation between the common people and the
nobility was very much more clearly defined than at the
present day. We find no indication that the order was resisted
in any part of the country. It is probable that the
serfdom had gradually become largely nominal and the people
only gradually came to realize what the edict realty meant.
Even to this day the spirit of serfdom is a marked characteristic
of the people.</p>

<p class='c000'>His ninetieth year beheld the complete mental and physical
collapse of the king. He could not attend to the ancestral
sacrifices; his mind continually wandered from the subject in
hand. He would order a meeting of his councillors and then
forget that he had ordered it, or forget what he had ordered
it for.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hong In-han hated the young Crown Prince. It had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>long been his ambition to see on the throne the son of the
princess who had given up the project of becoming queen.
He worked with all his might to have the fatal day put off,
when the royal seals should be put in the hands of the prince.
He was all the more dangerous as he was the prince’s uncle,
and therefore more difficult to handle.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the aged king insisted upon giving up, this man
said, “Not yet, you have many years more to reign,” and he
succeeded in delaying the matter, hoping that something might
intervene to prevent the consummation that he dreaded. At
one time when the king called a clerk to record his decree
that the Crown Prince, from that day, should assume the
reins of power, Hong violently pushed the clerk away and
prevented it. The officials were all in a state of trepidation
over these high-handed proceedings, fearing that they might
become compromised, but help was at hand. Sŭ Myŭng-sŭn
memorialized the king and set forth this Hong in such a light
that the king with a last effort asserted himself and the young
prince became king. A near friend of Hong was banished as
a hint that Hong himself might expect punishment if he
persisted in making trouble. Early the next year more of
Hong’s friends were banished. The aged king took the newly
appointed King to the shrine of his foster father and made him
swear that he would ever consider himself the son of that
man rather than of his real father. The young man asked
that the record of his father’s death be expunged from the official
records and so they were taken outside the Northwest
Gate and “washed” in the stream.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the third moon of 1776 the old man died. The new king
is known by his posthumous title of Chöng-jong Tă-wang.
He immediately raised his adopted father to the rank of Chin-jong
Tă-wang and gave his real father the title Chang-hön Se-ja.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reign just ended had been rich in literary products.
The names of same of the books published are: “How to deal
with the native fever,” “The <a id='corr182.35'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='eveil'>evil</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_182.35'>evil</a></span> deeds of the Soron party,”
“Conduct and Morals,” “Fortifications and Military Tactics,”
“A Catechism of Morals,” “A reprint of the Confucian work
So-hak-ji,” “An Abstract, in 100 volumes, of five important
historical and geographical works.” This last was called the
Mun-hön Pi-go.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>In spite of the oath that he had taken, the young king
built a separate shrine to his father and worshiped at it in
the same manner as at the ancestral temple. This was in accord
with the letter of the oath, for he religiously refrained,
from calling his father by that name. He likewise honored
the memory of his father by decreeing that if anyone mentioned
the fact that he had been enclosed in a box and starved
to death it would mean death. He banished the son of the
princess who had encompassed his father’s death. The high-handed
Hong In-han who had worked so hard to prevent his
accession was first banished to Yö-san and enclosed in a thorn
hedge, and then was poisoned by royal edict.</p>

<p class='c000'>His first year of rule was marked by an attempt to assassinate
him and put his brother on the throne, but the assassin
was taken, knife in hand, and upon his confession Hong
Sang-bom and his whole family were seized and put to death.
At last in sheer self-defense the king was obliged to put
his brother to death. At the same time he forbade the presence
of sorceresses in the capital and banished many who
had been instrumental in his father’s death. From this it
would appear that there was a powerful clique in Seoul who
were trying every means to accomplish his overthrow.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being without issue, the king, at the instigation of his
mother, took a concubine, the sister of one of his favorites,
Hong Kuk-yung. This resulted very unfortunately, for
when this concubine died her father was drawn into treasonable
operations.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many of the present customs of Korea date from this
reign. The king first made the law that after the closing
of the gates, they could not be opened except by special permission
from himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was in his first year that the scholar Kwŭn Chŭl-sin
gathered about him a company of disciples and went to a
mountain retreat to study. They possessed one copy of a
Christian work. This they diligently studied, and one and all
determined to adopt the belief there inculcated. So far as
they understood it, they practiced its teachings in secret.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two years later the king took as a second concubine the
daughter of Yun Ch‘ang-yun, and Hong the father of the
first concubine, because of his opposition to it, was banished.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Up to this time very few officials had been drawn from the
northern provinces or from Song-do, but now the king decreed
that they were as worthy to receive office as any others and
said that they should share in the gifts of the government.
He ordered that, a record be kept of all the decisions in council
and that they be preserved in a book called the Il-deuk-rok.
Those were days of severe famine in the land and the king
did all in his power to relieve the distress, giving from his
private treasure large quantities of silver bullion, black pepper
and dyewood, things of great value in Korea.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1783 strange rumors were afloat. It was said
that war had been declared against Korea by some foreign
power which was about to throw an immense army into the
peninsula. No one knew where it was to come from, but
many believed it was Japan. The excitement grew so strong
that crowds of people fled to the country, and so great was
the influx into the southern provinces that real estate rose
rapidly in value. Such was the haste of these deluded people
that on the road families became separated and children were
lost. Out of pity for the latter the king founded an asylum
in Seoul for their maintenance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yi Tŭk-cho of Kyöng-ju was one of the men who had
accepted the teachings of the Roman Catholic books and in
this year he induced a young attaché of the embassy to
Peking to look up the missionaries there and get such light as
he could on the subject. This young man, Yi Sŭng-hun, met
at Peking the Portugese Alexandré de Govea of the Franciscan
order. He accepted Christianity and was baptized under
the name of Pierre. He brought back with him many books,
crosses, images and other religious emblems. Some of these
he gave to Yi Tŭk-cho who redoubled his studies and at the
same time began to do some proselyting. Two of his most
celebrated converts were two brothers Kwŭn Ch‘ul-sin and
Kwŭn Il-sin of Yang-geun, thirty miles from Seoul. This
town is called the birth-place of Roman Catholicism in Korea.
Yi Tŭk-cho took the baptismal name of Jean Baptiste and
Kwŭn Il-sin that of Francois Xavier. The propagation of
the Christian faith soon began in Seoul and from there rapidly
spread in the south.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1785 the Minister of Justice began active operations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>against the new faith and in the third moon of that year a
courtier memorialized the king on the subject. This caused
the defection of many of the converts.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1786 Kim Yi-so informed the king that when envoys
came back from China they brought in their train many Catholic
books, which caused a “conflagration” in the country,
and he denounced it as a bad religion. He said the books
were flooding the land and that the only way to stop it was to
make Eui-ju, on the border, a customs port and have all baggage
strictly examined before being allowed to pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many Chinese had settled on Sin Island off Eui-ju but
the Koreans on the adjacent mainland resented it. They collected
a considerable band of men and crossed to the island
where they burned all the houses of the settlers and destroyed
all their property. When the king heard of it he condemned
it as a brutal outrage. This year was marked by one of the
most destructive scourges that ever visited the country.
Cholera swept the land from end to end. It is asserted that
370,979 people perished, among whom was the infant Crown
Prince. The government found it necessary to undertake the
work of <a id='corr185.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='interment'>interment.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_185.21'>interment.</a></span> The king gave out from the dispensary
29,000 pills, and in Seoul alone there were 8,149 recoveries.
Knowing as we do the frightful ravages of this disease when
it takes a virulent turn, the fact that there were over 8,000 recoveries
in Seoul indicates that there must have been at least
60,000 deaths. Probably this was more than half the population
of the city at that time. It was during this same year
that the great mound in Kang-dong, P‘yŭng-an Province,
was found. It is some 680 feet in circumference. It was
called, from the first, the grave of the Tan-gun, though there
is of course no evidence to show that this is more than the
merest fancy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The king had a half brother named Prince Eun-ön for
whom he had a great affection; but Hong Kuk-Yŭng whose
daughter had been the king’s first concubine and had violently
opposed a second union, now conspired with two other
choice spirits with a view to putting Prince Eun-ön on the
throne. The vigilant Queen Mother discovered the plot and
the conspirators were executed. All likewise demanded the
death of the young prince but to this the king would not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>listen. He was forced to banish him to Quelpart, but a short
time after had him brought back as far as Kang-wha, where
comfortable quarters were provided for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The king interdicted the use of silk excepting by very
high officials and by very old people. He set up stones to
mark the place where the great-grandfather of T’ă-jo Tă-wang
had lived, where his grandfather had fished and where that
king himself had once lived, in Ham-gyŭng Province. Someone
found in P’yŭng ch’ang, Ham-gyŭng Province, the grave
of T’ă-jo Tă-wang’s great-grandmother and the king had it
repaired and guarded.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up to that date the women had been accustomed to wear
the hair in a great bunch on top of the head as female professional
mourners do to-day in Korea. Large amounts of false
hair were used and it was decorated with long pins and with
flowers. It is said that a full headdress cost as much as the
furnishings of a house. The king ordered a change in this
expensive custom, and since that day only mourners and
palace women have been allowed to wear them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The city of Su-wŭn dates its importance from the year
1789, for at that time the king removed his father’s grave to
that place and went there several times to sacrifice. He
secretly called his banished brother from Kang-wha, but when
his mother learned of it she made such an ado about it that he
was fain to send him back. At Ham-heung, near the ancestral
seat of the dynasty, there was an immense tree, so large that
ten men holding each other’s hands could but just encircle
it. The shadow which it cast was “A hundred furrows
wide.” So goes the story. The king had it enclosed in
a wall, as being the place where his great ancestor practiced
archery.</p>

<p class='c000'>The year 1791 will always be memorable for the persecution
of the Roman Catholics. During the preceding year
the Roman Catholic converts had sent a man to Peking to arrange
for the coming of a priest who could administer the sacraments,
for the Koreans had been strictly forbidden by the
Catholic authorities in China to administer them among themselves
without the services of a regularly consecrated priest.
At the same time certain important questions about ancestor
worship were asked. A priest was promised to the Korean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>church but the answers to the questions about ancestor worship
were very unsatisfactory to the Koreans and in consequence
there were many defections. It is much to the credit
of the Roman propaganda that from the very first it set its
face hard against the practice of ancestor worship. In the
fifth moon it is said the “flame of Roman Catholicism burned
high.” In other words it was discovered then what had been
going on quietly for many years. Two men of Chin-san in
Chŭl-la Province were caught and killed because they had
burned their ancestral tablets. It was only after long discussion
and with great hesitation that the order was given for
their decapitation, and at the very last moment, after the men
had already been carried to the place of execution, the king
changed his mind and sent a reprieve; but it was too late. The
king called the new religion not Ch‘ŭn-ju-hak or “Religion of
the Lord of Heaven,” but Sa-hak or “The Deceiving Religion.”
The Minister Choă Che-gong advised the king to annihilate
all Roman Catholics, but the king answered, “We
must do it by elevating Confucianism.” He had found the
only rational way to deal with religious differences. He said,
in substance, let the fittest survive. This is all that Christianity
asks in any land, and the opposition of it by force
always has been and always will be an acknowledgment of inferiority.
The king knew well that China was the source
from which the new influences came and he made a very strict
law against the bringing across the border of Christian books.
An edict was promulgated threatening with punishment all
who did not deliver up their Christian books within twenty
days, and the prefect of Chin-san, where the two men had
been working, was cashiered and forty-five other prefects
were degraded one or two degrees, because Christian converts
were numerous in their districts. The Roman Catholic writers
attribute the numerous defections at this time to the entire
lack of pastoral care, the absence of the sacraments and the
paucity of Christian literature.</p>

<p class='c000'>The king did not live up to his advanced ideas about using
physical force to combat Christianity, for in the eleventh
moon of this year four high officials who had embraced Christianity
were seized and put to death, together with a considerable
number of the common people.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>In 1792 the pope formally put the care of the Korean
church in the hands of the Bishop of Peking.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sacrifices were offered at the tombs of Tan-gun, Ki-ja,
Su-ro-wang (the founder of Karak) and of T’ă-jo Tă-wang.
Whether this was done to aid in combatting Christianity we
are not told but it is not improbable. This was a time of
general prosperity among the people and it witnessed a
rapid increase in the population of Korea. These things
were evidenced by the strong colonizing spirit which sprang
up. Thousands flocked northward to the banks of the Yalu
and to the islands on the coast, and the area of arable land
was largely increased. Two years later this period of prosperity
terminated in a terrible famine in all the southern and
central provinces, and the government was obliged to dispense
280,000 bags of rice among the sufferers. This same year
envoys from the Liu Kiu Islands were well received. The
King told them that two hundred years before Liu Kiu officials
had been given honorary titles by the king of Korea. In
view of the friendly relations that had always existed between
Korea and these islands, the envoys were feasted and
sent off in grand style. Late in this same year, 1794, the
Chinese Roman Catholic priest Tsiou crossed the Yalu and
entered Korea. The government was aware of it and his arrest
was ordered, but he escaped from Seoul in disguise. Two
of his companions were taken, and as they refused to give
information as to his whereabouts they were immediately put
to death. At the time of his coming the Catholics estimate
that there were 400 <a id='corr188.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='belivers'>believers</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_188.28'>believers</a></span> in Korea, but within a very few
years the number increased to 6,000.</p>

<p class='c000'>The year 1796 was signalised by a most important event
in the field of letters. In the beginning of the dynasty a fount
of 100,000 pieces of moveable copper types had been cast, and
these had been supplemented soon after by 200,000 more.
Now the king began to add to them. First he put out 50,000
and a year later he added 150,000 more; then 80,000 more
were made, and moveable wooden types were made to the
number of 320,000. Already during this reign the following
works had appeared. “The Gradation of Penalties,” “A
Commentary on the Chinese Classics,” “The Proper Conduct
of the king,” “The Record of the Decisions in Council,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>“On Korean Customs,” “On Military Tactics,” “On Forms
of Official Correspondence,” “On the Science of Government.”
These were now followed by several editions of
military and Confucian works, one of which was a digest of
all the Confucian Classics in ninety-nine volumes. The King
was a great lover of books and gathered all the best books
that could be procured. One work whose publishing he
superintended in person reached the modest number of 191
volumes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Minister of Finance advised the minting of five-cash
pieces but all the officials united in a protest against it and
advised retrenchment as the alternative. In this they were
right, for the policy of meeting a deficit by minting money
could not but be disastrous.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1799 a peculiar plague broke out in <a id='corr189.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='P’yeng-yang'>P’yŭng-yang</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_189.31'>P’yŭng-yang</a></span> and
spread with great rapidity. It began with fever and ague,
accompanied by a cough, and death was very sudden. The
king decided that if people so afflicted should eat beef they
would recover. So he ordered cattle to be killed and the beef
to be distributed among the people. The plague suddenly
ceased and the people have always believed that it was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>marvelous acumen of the king that enabled him to see the
remedy and stop the ravages of the disease.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in 1800 he made his son heir to the throne, and
none too soon, for in the sixth moon he sickened and died.
It is said that his death was caused by his mourning over the
terrible fate of his father, whose cruel and untimely death
preyed upon his mind. Others say that the cause of his death
was a malignant boil.</p>

<p class='c000'>The infant king, known by his posthumous title of Sun-jo
Tă-wang, was of too tender an age to undertake the duties
of royalty and so the government was administered during
his minority by his grandmother, the woman who had wielded
such a strong influence over his father. She began by instituting
various reforms. Outside the West Gate, which was
then some distance to the west of the present New Gate,
there was a monastery where sorceresses and fortune-tellers
congregated. The Queen Mother drove them all out and
razed the monastery to the ground. The tax by which the
palace body-guard was kept up was very distasteful to the
people and it was now remitted. Up to this time the
government medical dispensary had been supported by revenue
in money or herbs from the country, but this tax was
also remitted. If we may believe the records when they say
that she freed all the government slaves, we can not but confess
that in some directions at least this Queen Regent was
of exceeding liberal mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is from the year 1801 that we may date the determined
and systematic opposition on the part of the government
against the Roman Catholic propaganda in the peninsula.
Two other factions had grown up in Seoul, the Si and the
Pyŭk. The latter were violent opponents of the new religion
but they had been held in check by the neutral attitude of the
late king. But now he was dead, and the Queen Regent,
being a member of that faction, determined to give full rein
to the anti-Christian prejudices of her partisans. It must be
remembered that the Koreans were extremely sensitive to
outside influences. The terrible invasion of the Japanese on
the one hand and of the Manchus on the other had made the
Koreans hate all suggestions of commerce with the outside
world, and they sedulously avoided every possible contact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>with foreigners. This is one of the main causes of the opposition
to Christianity. But besides this, they had been told
that Roman Catholicism struck at the very foundation of the
state and was more than likely to assume a political aspect, a
charge which, from the very claims which it puts forth to
universal temporal as well as spiritual sovereignty, would be
somewhat hard to refute. We can scarcely wonder then that
there was severe opposition to it. It was looked upon as a
danger which menaced the state. It is said that Roman
Catholicism had assumed large proportions in Korea. Many
were now seized and put to death. Among them were eleven
high officials. Release was granted in case the accused would
consent to curse Christ. The agents of this persecution went
everywhere haling forth believers from city and village. Soon
the prisons were running over. Eleven men were executed
in April and fourteen in the following month. It is said that
two princesses who had adopted the foreign faith were put to
death. It was at this time that Tsiou, the Chinese evangelist,
whom the Koreans call Chu Mun-mo, was seized and put to
death outside the Little West Gate. He had at first fled
north to the Yalu and was on the point of crossing, when he
suddenly thought better of it, turned back, gave himself up
and heroically met his death.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Korean named Whang Sa-yong had been instrumental
in bringing this Chinaman to preach the faith to his fellow-countrymen.
Now that the evangelist was executed this
Whang sent out a letter to the European residents of China
asking that a military expedition be gotten up to come to the
shores of Korea, overthrow the dynasty and set up another in
sympathy with the Christian faith. This letter was intercepted,
the man seized and cruelly torn to pieces. As to the
accuracy of these statements it would be rash to vouch. The
contents of that letter may or may not have been what is
generally believed by the Koreans, but judging from the active
interest which European governments rightly take in missionaries
from their shores, it is not unlikely that the letter contained
substantially what is here stated. The persecution
terminated the following year when the government ordered
the execution of those already apprehended but ordered that
no more Christians be proceeded against. Between three and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>four hundred people had perished and the church seemed to
have been crushed.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was in this year 1803 that a terrible conflagration
swept P‘yŭng-yang, and a thousand houses were destroyed.
It was repeated the following year, and it is asserted that almost
the entire city was destroyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon the death of the Queen Regent in 1805 the last remnant
of persecution ceased and even the law which prohibited
the import of books was allowed to remain a dead letter.
Corruption in government circles ran riot. The state of
things is well epitomized in a memorial which was sent in at
this time. (1) The Ministers spend all their time reading
books. (2) Nepotism and bribery are the rule rather than
the exception. (3) The judges sit and wait for bribes. (4)
The examiners of the candidates’ papers receive money in
advance, and merit can make no headway against cupidity.
(5) The censors have been struck dumb. (6) The prefects
do nothing but extort money from the people. (7) Luxury
saps the strength and wealth of the land. (8) The whole
commonwealth is diseased and rotten to the core.</p>

<p class='c000'>The year 1811 is marked by an uprising in the north,
where Hong Kyöng nă attempted to set up a kingdom of his
own. He was a resident of P‘yŭng-an Province and was a man
of enormous wealth. He was disaffected against the government
because the men of his section were discriminated against
in the distribution of offices; so he conferred with the miners
who were engaged in digging gold in various places, and he
told them an exaggerated story of how ill they were being
treated by the government. He ended by proposing that, as
he had enough money for them all, they set up a kingdom of
their own. The hardy miners, 5,000 in number, accepted the
proposal with alacrity and war was on foot. This company of
undrilled but hardy miners were formidable and at first carried
everything before them. They first took the town of Chöng-ju,
putting to death the prefect and his whole family.
When news of this reached Seoul the king appointed Yi Yo-hön
as general-in-chief against the rebels. Five thousand
soldiers were given him with which to do the work. He acted
in a characteristic manner, settled himself comfortably at the
governor’s house outside the New Gate and called it the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>headquarters. From that point he sent to the front Generals
Sŭ Kum-bo, Kim Kye-on and Pak Keui-p‘ung. Meanwhile
the rebels were carrying everything before them. Ch‘ŭl-san,
Ka-san, Song-ch‘ŭn, Yong ch‘ŭn, Pak-ch‘ŭn and Son-ch‘ŭn
fell in quick succession. All the government provisions and
arms fell into their hands. The main camp of the rebels was
in the vicinity of An-ju and they wished to take that place.
Here they met with strenuous opposition and it was only after
a desperate struggle that they ever took the town. It took
ten days to reduce the place; but the back bone of the revolt
was broken before the government troops from Seoul arrived
on the scene. The various captains and local commanders
joined their forces, and by the time the government troops had
collected in P’yŭng-yang the rebels had been driven into their
last remaining fortress, Chöng-ju, and were being held in
siege. During the retreat of the rebels four of Hong’s lieutenants
were captured and, being sent to Seoul, were there
summarily executed. The reduction of Chöng-ju by siege
was a work of some time, and the king becoming impatient,
supplanted Gen. Pak Kye-p‘ung and put Gen. Yu Hyo-wŭn
in his place. The latter immediately decided to attempt to
blow up the town of Chöng-ju. Constructing a fence, or barrier
of some kind, a hundred and fifty paces from the wall, he
began, under cover of this, to mine the wall, supporting the
passage with beams of wood. When he had extended the
passage well under the wall he placed a large amount of
powder in it and attached a long fuse. After igniting the fuse
the soldiers all hastened out of the mine. No explosion followed.
No one dared to go in, for fear that the fuse might be
burning slowly and that the mine might explode while they
were within. After waiting two days, and finding no one
who would venture in, Gen. Yu himself entered and found
that the fuse had become wet. He remedied the difficulty
and soon there was a tremendous explosion that tore down a
long stretch of the wall and buried many of the garrison in
the debris. The place was soon taken. Hong was caught,
“The Man who Would be King,” and his head was sent to
Seoul.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Christians had now begun to recover in some measure
from the terrible persecution of 1801 and a man was sent to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Peking to urge that a qualified priest be sent to Korea, but
the Peking church itself was in great vicissitudes and no help
could be promised.</p>

<p class='c000'>From this time on the reign was one long list of calamities
which followed thick and fast upon each other. In 1813
there was a serious rebellion on the island of Quelpart; in
1814 occurred one of those fearful famines that sometimes
happen in the southern provinces; this was followed by a flood
in Kyŭng-sang Province which wrecked thousands of houses
and cost many lives; Seoul was without rice and the government
had to open its granaries and sell at starvation rates;
414,000 bags of grain were distributed to the sufferers in the
country and 15,000,000 cash, 5,000 pounds of dye-wood and
500 pounds of black pepper were donated toward relief. The
next year thousands who had been made destitute by the
famine flocked to Seoul and the government had to feed them
till the barley crop was harvested; then the native fever, a
kind of typhus, broke out and mowed the people down, and
the government had to erect pest houses for their accommodation.
In 1816 two thousand houses fell in a freshet
in Ch’ung-ch’ŭng Province and the government gave timber
to help the people rebuild. The year 1821 beheld one of the
most terrible scourges of cholera that the country ever experienced.
It began in the north, and sweeping southward
soon involved the capital. Ten thousand people died in Seoul
in ten days. In the south it was equally destructive. The
government was obliged to appoint a commission to attend to
the interment of the dead bodies along the road. The following
year it broke out again with unbated fury. Houses were
built at intervals along the roads, by the government, for the
sake of those who might be struck down with the plague while
traveling and gangs of men were kept busy along the main
road burying the dead. It even crossed to the island of Quelpart
where two thousand people died. In 1824 the government
had to remit 69,300 bags of revenue grain in the north
because of the depredations of robber bands.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1827 the Crown Prince was appointed deputy king
and the same year a son was born to him. But troubles continued.
The government was obliged to remit taxes of seaweed,
salt, ginseng and fish in Kang-wŭn Province. The following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>year a terrible freshet swept away whole villages in
Ham-gyŭng Province and the king sent large quantities of
grain to feed the destitute there.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still troubles multiplied thick and fast. In 1830 the
Crown Prince died. He is the grandfather of the present
Emperor of Korea. The son who had been born to him is
known as the Tă wŭn-gun, who died in the spring of 1898.
The building in which the body of this Crown Prince was
placed burned to the ground and nothing but the charred
bones of the prince were recovered. Two years later, in 1832
an English vessel appeared off Hong-ju and its captain, Basil
Hall, sent the king a letter saying that he had come to trade,
but the king refused permission. As the flag of the ship bore
the device “Religion of Jesus Christ,” some Roman Catholic
converts boarded her, but when they found that they were
protestants they beat a hasty retreat. It is said that several
boxes of books were landed and that some of them were sent
to the king, who promptly returned them. The foreigners
who made this attempt to enter Korea were Gutzlaff and
Lindsay.</p>

<p class='c000'>During this year there were destructive fires and floods,
but the greatest calamity of all was a famine that began at
that time and continued for nine successive years, each year
being accompanied with cholera. It is said that bodies were
piled in heaps inside the South Gate. Many people are still
living who remember that terrible time. The next year, in
addition to famine and plague, the palace burned down. In the
following year there was a devastating epidemic of native
fever in Seoul, and a flood in Eui-ju which wrecked 2,000
houses. That summer, the people driven wild with hunger
mobbed the government granaries but found nothing in them.
They laid the blame on the Prime Minister and threatened
his life. He fled precipitately to the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the last moon of 1834 the king died and his grandson
a boy nine years old came to the throne. He is known as
Hön jong Tă-wang. His grandmother Kim became regent.
She is known as Sun-wŭn Whang-ho. She immediately began
a work of reform. The law that made the relatives of prefects’
clerks liable to punishment for their crimes was abrogated.
Many burdensome taxes were remitted. The government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>revenue collectors were kept to a strict account for all the
monies passing through their hands. A conspiracy, headed
by one Nam Ong-jung, was put down with a strong hand.
The people were commanded not to slaughter their cattle for
food, for the only hope for future crops was the cattle, without
which the land could not be tilled. All prefects were commanded
to have regular office hours during which they should
attend to government business exclusively.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1831 Pope Gregory XVI had made Korea a bishopric
and appointed M. Bruguiere as Bishop. A Chinaman named
Yu who was then in Europe was appointed to accompany him to
Korea. This man Yu went ahead and found means of entering
Korea secretly. M. Bruguiere worked three years in the
attempt to enter the country by way of the north across the
Yalu and at last died on the very border. Yu who had <a id='corr196.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>preceeded</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_196.15'>preceeded</a></span>
him desired to hold supreme power in the Korean
church, and so put obstacles in the way of the entrance of the
Bishop. But in the following year Pierre Philibert Maubant,
who had been appointed to Korea, succeeded in entering the
country and began work in Seoul at once, but of course in
secret. By <a id='corr196.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='1737'>1837</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_196.21'>1837</a></span> two other French priests had arrived, including
Bishop Imbert. It is said that at the time of his arrival
there were 9,000 adherents of the Roman Catholic church.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the king was still but fourteen years old, in 1839,
there occurred a cruel persecution of the Catholics. Three
foreigners were in Korea, as we have seen, and they were
known to the Koreans as Pöm Se-hyŭng, Na-bă Do-ru and
Chöng-ă Kak-bak-i.</p>

<p class='c000'>The persecution began as usual with a change of ministry.
Yi Chi-ŏn became Prime Minister. He hated Christianity and
averred that the reason why there were so many Christians
was that the work of extermination had not been thoroughly
carried out in 1801. He demanded a house to house inspection.
This was done and soon the prisons were full to overflowing.
Hundreds were cruelly beaten, but the yamen-runners
were not allowed to loot the houses of the prisoners,
which cooled their ardor not a little. Finally the three
foreigners were arrested. Being ordered to leave the country
they firmly refused. Thereupon they were declared high
criminals and were executed on Sept. 21st, 1839. This was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>followed by still severer <a id='corr197.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='presecutions'>persecutions</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_197.1'>persecutions</a></span> and even the Koreans
themselves grew tired of the horrors that were enacted. It
is said that seventy were decapitated and that sixty died of
beating and strangulation. This is but a fraction however of
those who perished in consequence of this persecution.</p>

<p class='c000'>The last ten years of the reign were marked principally
by events connected with the Roman Catholic propaganda.
In 1844 two more French priests entered the country by way
of Quelpart after a most difficult and hazardous passage from
China in a Korean junk. Two years later the French
government sent a message to Korea by a gun-boat, complaining
of the death of the three Frenchmen and threatening
her with punishment if these cruel actions were continued.
This only excited the Koreans the more against Christianity,
for it seemed to imply that Roman Catholicism had
behind it a temporal power, and was therefore of political
significance. In consequence of this a new outbreak occurred
which cost the lives of several more Koreans, while the
two priests were obliged to hide away very closely in the
country.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the summer of 1847 two French boats, the frigate
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>la Gloire</em></span> and the corvette <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>la Victorieuse</em></span> set sail from the
Gulf of Pechili to go to Korea and ascertain what had been
the result of the former letter. These two boats both struck
a mud-bank and when the tide went down they broke in two.
The crews to the number of 600 escaped to the neighboring
island of Kogeum off the province of Chŭl-la, and a pinace
was immediately despatched to Shanghai for aid. The Koreans
gave every assistance in their power and supplied
them with food and other necessaries, and even offered to
provide boats to take the men back to China. In fact the
action of the Korean government was most creditable throughout.
An English ship happened to come by and it carried
the survivors all back to China. The Korean government,
fearing further visits from the French, decided to answer the
letter of the previous year. It was couched in the following
terms:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Last year we received a letter from the foreigners. It
was addressed to the ministers of this realm and read as follows:
‘Three of our countrymen, Imbert, Chastan and Maubant,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>have been put to death by you. We come to demand
why you have killed them. You will say perhaps that your
law forbids foreigners entering your country, but if Chinese
or Manchus should happen to enter your realm you would
not kill them, but you would have them carried back to their
own country. Why then did you not treat these men the
same way? If they had been convicted of murder, sedition
or a like crime we would have nothing to say, but they were
innocent, and in condemning them unjustly you have committed
a grave injury against the French government.’ To
this letter we beg to reply as follows: In 1839 there were
arrested here certain strangers who were brought into the
country at a time unknown to us. They wore Korean clothes,
they spoke the Korean language, they traveled by night and
slept by day; they veiled their faces, concealed their whereabouts
and consorted with men whom we consider rebels,
godless men and enemies of the government. When brought
before the tribunal they claimed that their names were Pierre
No and Japanese Cang. Are these the men you refer to?
When interrogated, they said nothing about being Frenchmen,
and even if they had we could not have sent them back,
for we did not know where your country is. What could we
do but apply our law, which forbids secret entrance into our
kingdom? On the other hand, their conduct in changing their
names and wearing Korean dress shows that they had ulterior
motives, and they cannot be compared to those who have been
shipwrecked upon our shores. Such men we save if possible
and aid to send back home. Such is our law. Had your fellow-countrymen
been shipwrecked upon our coast, they would have
received precisely the same treatment as Chinese, Japanese or
Manchus under like circumstances. You say that these men
were killed without cause and that we have committed a
grave offense against the French government. This is most
astonishing. We have never had any communication with
France. We do not know even how far she is from Korea.
What motive could we possibly have for injuring her? How
would you act if a foreigner should enter your country secretly
and in disguise and do what you consider evil? Would
you leave him alone? If a Chinaman or a Manchu should
come here and do as your people did they would be treated in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>the same manner as we did your people. In fact, we did put
to death a Chinaman because he came here in disguise and
changed his costume; and the Chinese government never
said a word about it, for they knew this to be our law. Even
had we known their nationality, their actions were so contrary
to our laws that we could hardly have spared them,
how much less then when we did know it. This matter
hardly needs more explanation. Your letter was sent without
the proper formalities and we are not bound to answer it.
This is not a matter that a mere provincial governor can
handle. As we are China’s vassal it is our duty to consult
the court at Peking on all foreign matters. Tell this to your
chief and do not be surprised that in order to show the true
state of the case we have been led to speak thus plainly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>One needs but to read this to see that it is an unanswerable
argument. From a merely political and legal point
of view the Korean government had all the facts on her side,
though from the standpoint of humanity they were wrong. It
is strange that they omitted the strongest argument of all
namely, that they asked the Frenchmen to leave and they refused.
It is evident that by so doing they made themselves
amenable to Korean law, and took the consequences, good or
bad. One cannot admire enough the heroism which they displayed
in staying to suffer with their coreligionists, though
the opportunity was given them to save themselves by departure.
It cannot be doubted that the rapid spread of
Catholicism in Korea is due in large measure to the heroic
self-sacrifice of those men and others like them, who literally
gave their lives to the work. It would be wrong however to
say that the government was wholly without excuse. From
time immemorial death had been the penalty for crimes of far
less import to the Korean mind than the spreading of heretical
beliefs. With the light they had and the provocation
under which they labored we should say they needed rather
enlightenment than censure.</p>

<p class='c000'>This answer was not accepted as satisfactory by the
French government and a rejoinder was sent saying that
thereafter French subjects who should be taken on Korean
soil must be sent to Peking, otherwise the Korean government
would lay itself open to grave evils. But soon after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>this the revolution of 1848 took place in France and these
eastern questions were all forgotten for the time being.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1849 the king died without male issue and his grandmother
Kim nominated his nephew, the son of a banished
brother. The young man entered upon the duties of his office
at the age of nineteen and he is known by his posthumous
title of Ch’ŭl-jong Tă-wang. This reign of fourteen
years beheld some important reforms. The law was reaffirmed
that the families of banished men might follow them into
exile. Gambling was severely interdicted. The merchants’
monopolies were broken up. A hard fight was made against
bribery and peculation in high places. Country gentlemen
were forbidden to seize and beat any one belonging to the
lower orders.</p>

<p class='c000'>This king was the son Prince Chun-gye by a slave woman
named Kang. He was the great-grandson of the Crown
Prince, Sado, whom his father nailed up in the box.</p>

<p class='c000'>His reign was an important one in two respects. First
the very rapid spread of Roman <a id='corr200.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Catholcism'>Catholicism</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_200.19'>Catholicism</a></span> and second the
settled policy which was adopted toward all outside influences.
When the reign began there were about 11,000 Christians
in Korea and when it closed in 1863 there were in
the vicinity of 20,000, or almost double. Everyone knew
that to combat it there would be need of a king of a different
calibre from Ch’ŭl jong; and so during these years the work
of propagating the new faith went on steadily and without
any considerable drawbacks. The picture of the country as
drawn by the French is indeed a sad one. They say the
king had shown himself quite incapable and had become a
mere <a id='corr200.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>debauche</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_200.30'>debauche</a></span>. The highest officials were fattening off the
people and the latter were frequently consulting the books of
prophecy which foretold the <a id='corr200.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='disolution'>dissolution</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_200.32'>dissolution</a></span> of the dynasty. And
now foreigners began to enter the country in greater numbers.
Maistre, Jansen, Berneux followed each other in
quick succession in the early fifties. The latter became
Bishop of Korea.</p>

<p class='c000'>About the end of 1860 came the news of the fall of Peking
before the combined French and English forces, the flight of
the Emperor and the burning and looting of the Summer
Palace. The news was that thousands of foreigners had come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>to overthrow the empire. The utmost consternation prevailed
in Seoul. An official memorialised the throne giving three
causes for lively concern.</p>

<p class='c000'>(1) The Emperor, fleeing before his enemies, might
wish to find asylum in Korea, or at least might take refuge in
some Manchu fortress just beyond the border. Every possible
approach ought to be strictly guarded so that the Emperor
might not dare to force his way into Korean territory. (This
shows the depth of Korea’s loyalty to <ins class='correction' title='China'>China.</ins>)</p>

<p class='c000'>(2) The outlaw bands that infested the neutral strip between
Korea and China might attempt an invasion of Korea
and forts ought to be built to prevent such an enterprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>(3) Worst of all, there might be a possible invasion of
Korea by the foreigners. Korean cities would be wrecked,
the morals of the people would be lowered, a depraved religion
would be established. As the foreigners were strong only on
the sea or on level ground the mountainous character of Korea
would be of material advantage to her. The army should
be reorganised, and forts should be built along the principal
approaches to Seoul; also at Tong-nă, Nam-yang, Pu-byŭng
and In-ju. A fort should be built on high ground commanding
the passage of the narrows at Kang-wha. Western boats
could not of course ascend the Han River. As the foreign
religion spread rapidly in the provinces every precaution should
be taken to prevent the foreign priests communicating with
their countrymen abroad.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ministry and the people all applauded this plan and
the memorialist was made a judge and given power to carry
out his scheme. But news came thick and fast telling of the
killing of thousands of Chinese soldiers, and the returning
embassy in February 1861, gave definite news of the flight of
the Emperor and the treaty wrested from the great Chinese
empire. This news electrified the people. All business was
suspended. The well-to-do people all fled to mountain retreats
the doughty memorialist among the first. The ministers
sent away their families and their goods. Many of the high
officials asked the protection of the Roman Catholics, and
tried to procure Roman Catholic books or badges of any kind,
and many wore these at their belts in broad daylight. The
yamen-runners were loud in their protestations that they had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>had nothing to do with the persecution of the Catholics. It
was believed by the French in Korea at the time that a most
favorable treaty could have been concluded just at that time:
but no effort in that direction was made by the French.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gradually the excitement abated and preparations for
war were pushed, the wealthy classes supplying the money
for the same. Old arms were resurrected, and cannon were
cast on the model of one obtained from the French wrecks.
At this time there were nine Frenchmen in Korea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The year 1861 was a hard one for the people. They
were taxed to the last farthing and local riots were exceedingly
common. The French give us an amusing incident,
where the widows of a certain prefecture were taxed. They
rose up <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</span></em> and mobbed the prefect’s office, caught his
mother, tore off all her garments and left her well nigh naked.
This of course meant that the prefect was disgraced for life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The events of the present reign, which began in January
1864, are fresh in the memory of many still living, and the
account here given is taken largely from statements of eye-witnesses
of the scenes therein described. A detailed history
of the present reign would fill a volume in itself and of course
we can but briefly touch upon the leading events in it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>The circumstances which ushered in the reign are graphically
described by Dallet and are substantially as follows.
King Ch’ŭl-jong had been suffering for some time with a pulmonary
affection, but in January of 1864 he seemed better
and he began to walk about a little. On the fifteenth, feeling
greater uneasiness than usual, he went into his garden for a
walk. There he was suddenly taken with faintness and was
just able to drag himself back to his room, where he fell in a
dying condition. The Minister Kim <a id='corr203.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>Choa-geun</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_203.9'>Choa-geun</a></span>, his son Kim
Pyŭng-gu and three other relatives were immediately in attendance.
As they were deliberating, the nephew of the
Dowager Queen Cho, widow of the King Ik-jong, happened
to pass, and seeing what was going on, he hastened to his
aunt’s apartments and exclaimed, “What are you doing here?
The king is dead.” He advised her to hasten to the king’s
apartments, gain possession of the royal seals and nominate
to the throne some one of her choice, declaring him to be the
son and heir of King Ik-jong, her husband. This woman
thereupon hastened to the side of the expiring king where
she found the attendants, as we have said, and with them the
queen, who held the royal seals in a fold of her skirt. The
Dowager Queen peremptorily demanded these seals, and when
the queen demurred she snatched them violently from her.
No one dared oppose the determined woman who thus took
fortune by the forelock and in the course of a moment turned
the course of empire. She then made proclamation in the
name of the king, saying “The king says the royal seals shall
be in charge of Queen Cho. The throne shall go to Myŭng-bok,
second son of Prince Heung-sŭng (whose name was Yi
Ha-eung). Minister Chong shall be executor of the king’s
will and Minister Kim shall go and find the newly appointed
king.” The Dowager Queen Cho thus became Regent
and the queen’s party, the Kim family, had to retire from
power.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was at the very beginning of the reign that the peculiar
sect called the Tong-hak arose in the south. Its founder was
one Ch'oe Pok-sul of Kyöng-ju in Kyŭng sang Province. The
great formula of the sect was the mysterious sentence <em>Ch’ŭn
Ju cho a chung yŭng se bul mang man sa eui</em>, which means
“May the Lord of Heaven aid our minds that we may ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>remember, and may He make all things turn out according to
our desire.” The adherents of this sect would sit and sing this
formula by the hour. They would also dance, brandishing
swords in a sort of frenzy, and pretend to be rising to heaven.
The name Tong-hak or “Eastern Sect” was given by themselves
to distinguish themselves from the Sŭ-hak or “Western
Sect,” namely Roman Catholicism. So at least some affirm.
Its rise was exceedingly rapid and soon it had enrolled an
enormous number of people. The government was at last
obliged to take cognizance of it, and a body of troops was
sent south, who captured and put to death the founder of the
sect. This put an end for the time to its active propagandism
but it was by no means dead, as we shall see.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dowager Queen Cho was a violent opponent of Christianity
and filled all the offices with enemies of the Roman
Catholics. But she was not to hold the reins of power long.
The king’s father in view of his son’s elevation to the
throne had received the title Prince Tă-wŭn, or Tă-wŭn-gun
as he is usually called. He was a man of commanding personality
and inflexible will and on the whole lie was the most
striking character in modern Korean history. He has been
variously estimated. Some have considered him the greatest
statesman in Korea; others have taken him for a mere demagogue.
His main characteristic was an indomitable will
which took the bit in its teeth and swept toward the goal of
its desire irrespective of every obstacle, whether of morals,
economics, politics or consanguinity. He was withal unable
to read the signs of the times. The two great mistakes of his
life were, first in supposing he could eradicate Roman Catholicism
by force, and second in supposing that he could prevent
the opening of Korea to treaty relations. The regency naturally
passed into his hands and he tacitly agreed to uphold the
principles of the conservative party that had raised him to
power.</p>

<p class='c000'>His first act was to order a remeasurement of the tilled
land of the country with a view to the increasing of the revenue.
The treasury was empty and he had plans in mind
that would require money. One of these plans was the erection
of a new palace on the ruins of the Kyöng-bok Palace, an
enterprise which the finances of the country by no means warranted.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>His next act was to betroth his son the king to his
wife’s niece. His wife had two brothers one of whom was
living but the other had died leaving one daughter. It was
this daughter of Min Ch’i-rok who became queen. She was
the king’s senior by four years. As her father as dead she
became the foster child of her uncle Min Ch’i-gu. In this
union, as every one knows, the Regent sought to cement his
own power, but, as every one likewise knows, he made a
serious mistake.</p>

<p class='c000'>In January 1866 a Russian gunboat dropped anchor in
the harbor of Wŭn-san and a letter was sent to Seoul asking
for freedom of trade with Korea. The answer given was that
as Korea was the vassal of China the matter must be negotiated
at Peking, and an envoy was dispatched for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is said that Roman Catholic adherents made use of the
great uneasiness which prevailed in government circles respecting
Russia to compose a letter urging that the only
way to ward off Russia was by making an alliance with
France and England. It is said that the Regent received this
communication and gave it special and, as some believe, favorable
attention. We are told that the Roman Catholics were
all in a most hopeful state, of mind, fully believing the hour
had come for the awakening of Korea. In the light of subsequent
events it is difficult to determine whether the Regent’s
interest in the plan was real or whether it was a ruse whereby
to make the final <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</span></em> all the more effective. All things
considered, the latter theory fits the facts more perfectly. The
French themselves believed the Regent was pushed on to the
great persecution of 1866 by the violent anti-Christian party
that had put him in power, and that it was simply another case of
“If thou do it not thou art not Caesar’s friend.” They found
fault with him for harboring the idea of a combination with
this foreign element and demanded the death of the foreign
priests and a general persecution. It is said the Regent reminded
them of the burning of the Summer Palace at Peking
and the taking of that Imperial Capital, but that they answered
that they had killed Frenchmen before without harm resulting,
and they could do it again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whatever may have been the pressure brought to bear
on him, he finally signed the death warrant of all the foreign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>priests in the land, and on February 23rd Bishop Berneux
was seized and thrown into the common jail, but two days
later he was transferred to the prison where noble prisoners
were confined. On the 26th he was brought before the tribunal
where he gave his name as Chang. He said he had come to
save the souls of the Koreans and that he had been in the
country ten years. He refused to leave except by force. As
the government had made up its mind as to its course, his
death warrant was then made out, and it ran thus: “The accused,
Chang, refuses to obey the king. He will not apostatize.
He will not give the information demanded. He refuses
to return to his own country. Therefore, after the usual
punishments, he will be decapitated.” While he was awaiting
his end, Bretenières, Beaulieu, and Dorie were taken, and
after similar trial were condemned to death. All four of these
heroic men were decapitated at the public execution ground
near the river on the eighth of March and their bodies were
buried together in a trench, from which they were recovered
six months later and given burial by Roman Catholic adherents.
Four days later two more priests, Petitnicolas and
Pourthiè were executed at the same place. It was the latter
who lost at this time not only his life but his priceless manuscripts,
a Korean Grammar and a Latin Korean-Chinese
Dictionary, on which he had been at work for ten years.
Three more of the priests, Daveluy, Aumaitre and Huin were
seized soon after this and put to death, but not till the latter
had despatched a letter to China, which was destined to turn
up long afterward. There were three priests left, Calais,
Feron and Ridel. The last of these was selected to attempt
the journey to China and give information of these terrible
events. After almost incredible labors he succeeded in getting
away from the shore of Whang-hă Province in a junk together
with eleven native believers, and made his way to
Chefoo. From there he hastened to Tientsin and informed
Admiral Roze of the death of his fellow-countrymen. The
Admiral promised to hasten to the rescue of the remaining two
and the avenging of those who had been slain; but a revolt in
Cochin-China prevented him from redeeming his promise
until the following September.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chinese government, through the annual embassy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>informed the king of Korea that the killing of foreigners was
an exceedingly foolish proceeding and that he had better make
peace with France on the best terms possible, for if China
could not withstand her surely Korea could not. The Regent
replied, however, that it was not the first time French blood
had remained unavenged in Korea.</p>

<p class='c000'>On June 24th an American sailing vessel, the “Surprise,”
was wrecked off the coast of Whang-hă Province. Her captain
and crew were hospitably treated and conducted to the
Chinese border with great care, by order of the Regent, who
thus illustrated the truth of the assertion that Korea would
do no harm to men who were ship-wrecked on her coast.
Even in the midst of an anti-foreign demonstration of the
most severe type, these men were humanely treated and sent
upon their way.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in September the sailing vessel “General Sherman”
entered the mouth of the Ta-dong River. She carried five
white foreigners and nineteen Asiatics. Her ostensible object
was trade. The governor of P‘yŭng-an Province sent,
demanding the cause of her coming and the answer was that
they desired to open up trade with Korea. Though told that
this was impossible, the foreign vessel not only did not leave
but, on the contrary, pushed up the river until she reached a
point opposite Yang-jak Island not far from the city of P’yŭng-yang.
It was only the heavy rains in the interior and an exceptionally
high tide that allowed her to get across the bar,
and soon she was stuck in the mud, and all hopes of ever
saving her were gone. This rash move astonished the Koreans
above measure. Something desperate must be the intentions
of men who would drive a ship thus to certain destruction.
After a time word came from the Regent to attack her if she
did not leave at once. Then the fight began, but without
effect on either side until the Koreans succeeded in setting
fire to the “General Sherman” with fire-rafts. The officers
and crew then were forced to drop into the water, where
many of them were drowned. Those that reached the shore
were immediately hewn down by the frenzied populace. The
trophies of this fight are shown today in the shape of the
anchor chains of the ill-fated vessel, which hang in one of the
gateways of P’yŭng-yang. No impartial student of both sides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>of this question can assert that the Koreans were specially
blame-worthy. The ship had been warned off but had rashly
ventured where no ship could go without being wrecked
even were all other circumstances favorable. The Koreans
could not know that this was a mere blunder. They took the
vessel, and naturally, to be a hostile one and treated her accordingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>In September the persecution of Roman Catholic adherents
was resumed. This is said to have been caused by a
letter from one of the Christians to the Regent urging a treaty
of peace with France. But by this time Admiral Roze was
ready to redeem his promise, and on the tenth of that month
Bishop Ridel boarded his flag-ship at Chefoo. The French
authorities had already informed the Chinese at Peking that
France did not recognise the suzerainty of China over Korea
and asserted that the land about to be conquered would be
disposed of as France wished without reference to the Pekin
government. It was decided to send the corvette <em>la Primauguet</em>,
and the aviso, <em>le Déroulède</em>, and the gunboat, <em>Tardif</em>,
to make a preliminary survey of the approaches to Seoul.
Bishop Ridel accompanied this expedition in the capacity of
interpreter. Arriving off Clifford Islands on the twentieth,
the little fleet entered Prince Jerome Gulf, and the following
day <em>le Déroulède</em> was sent to explore the entrance to the Han
River. Finding the channel between Kang-wha and the mainland
satisfactory, she returned to the anchorage and together
they steamed up the river the only casualty being the loss of
the false keel of the Primauguet. These vessels steamed up
the river as far as the river towns opposite the capital, silencing
a few forts on the way. Bishop Ridel used all his powers
of persuasion to induce the commander to leave one of these
boats here while the others went to China to report, but without
avail. They all steamed away together.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile there was panic in Seoul. The end had come,
in the estimation of many of the people. A general stampede
ensued and nearly a quarter of the citizens of Seoul fled away,
leaving their houses and goods. We will remember that when
Ridel escaped from Korea he left two companions behind.
These made a desperate attempt to communicate with the
French boats on the river, but so fierce was the persecution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>and so watchful were the authorities that they were quite unable
to do so. They finally escaped, however, by means
of junks which carried them out into the Yellow Sea,
where they fell in with Chinese boats that carried them to
China.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before the surveying expedition sailed back to China
Bishop Ridel was informed by native Christians of the burning
of the “General Sherman” and the fate of her crew, the
renewal of the persecution and the order that all Christians
be put to death after only a preliminary trial. He urged the
commandant to stay, but the fleet sailed away and reported in
China, where the real punitive expedition was rapidly preparing.
On October eleventh the blockade of the Han River
was announced to the Chinese authorities and to the various
powers through their representatives at Peking, and then the
French fleet sailed away to the conquest of Korea. The
flotilla consisted of the seven boats <em>Querriere</em>, <em>Laplace</em>, <em>Primauguet</em>,
<em>Deroulede</em>, <em>Kienchan</em>, <em>Tardif</em> and <em>Lebrethom</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But while these preparations were going on, other preparations
were going on in Korea. The total complement of
troops throughout the peninsula was called into requisition.
Arms were forged and troops drilled. The Japanese government,
even, was invited to take a hand in the war that was
impending, but she did not respond. Japan herself was
about to enter upon a great civil war, and had no force to spare
for outside work, even if she had had the desire.</p>

<p class='c000'>On October thirteenth the French fleet reached Korea
and three days later the attack on Kang-wha commenced. In
an hour’s time the town was in the possession of the French
and large amounts of arms, ammunition and provisions were
seized, besides various other valuables such as treasure, works
of art, books and porcelain. This reverse by no means
disheartened the Koreans. Gen. Yi Kyŭng-ha was put in
charge of the forces opposed to the “invaders.” This force
was led in person by Gen. Yi Wŭn-heui who found the
French already in possession of the fortress. The Koreans
were in force at Tong-jin just across the estuary from Kang-wha,
and, fearing that the vessels would attempt to ascend
the river, they sank loaded junks in the channel. This
channel must have been much deeper than it is today.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>The Regent swore that any man who should suggest
peace with the enemy should meet with instant death. A
letter was sent to the French saying that the priests had come
in disguise and had taken Korean names and had desired to
lay their hands on the wealth of the land. It declared that
the priests had been well killed. In reply the French said they
had come in the name of Napoleon, Sovereign of the Grand
French Empire, who desired the safety of his subjects, and
that since nine of his subjects had been killed, it must be explained.
They also demanded the three ministers who had
been foremost in the persecution and in the killing of the
priests should be handed over to them and that a plenipotentiary
be appointed for the ratifying of a treaty. To this letter
no answer was received.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile Gen. Yang Hön-su had led 5,000 men to the
fortress of Chöng-jok on Kang-wha where a celebrated monastery
stands. These men were mostly hardy mountaineers
and tiger-hunters from Kang-gye in the far north, the
descendants of those same men who in the ancient days of
Ko-yuryŭ drove back an army of Chinese 300,000 strong and
destroyed all but 700 of them. This fortress is admirably
situated for defense, lying as it does in a cup formed by a
semi-circle of mountains and approachable from only one
direction, where it is guarded by a crenellated wall and a
heavy stone gate.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great mistake of the French was in supposing this
place could be stormed by a paltry 160 men. The whole
French force could not have done it. No sooner had this
little band come well within range of the concealed garrison
than it was met by a withering fire which instantly put half
of them <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>hors de combat</em></span>. After some attempts to make a
stand in the shelter of trees, huts, rocks and other cover, a
retreat was called and the French moved slowly back carrying
their dead and wounded. They were closely pursued and
with difficulty made their way back to the main body. The
result would probably have been much more serious had not
the retreating party been met by a body of reinforcements
from the main body. The next day orders were given to fire
the town and re-embark. This caused great surprise and dissatisfaction
among the men, but we incline to the belief that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>it was the only thing to do. The number of men that had
been mustered to effect the humiliation of Korea was ridiculously
small compared with what was necessary. Six thousand
French might have done it, but six hundred—never.
We need seek no further than this for the cause of the abandonment
of the enterprise. To be sure, it had done infinitely
more harm than good, and if it had been possible to succeed
even at a heavy cost of life it would have been better to go
on; but it was not possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>The effect of this retreat upon the Regent and the court
may be imagined. Peking had fallen before these “barbarians”
but the tiger-hunters of the north had driven them
away in confusion. If the reader will try to view this event
from the ill-informed standpoint of the Korean court, he will
see at once that their exultation was quite reasonable and
natural. The last argument against a sweeping persecution
of Christians was now removed and new and powerful arguments
in favor of it were added. The fiat went forth that the
plague of the foreign religion should be swept from the land.
No quarter was to be given. Neither age nor sex nor quality
were to weigh in the balance. From that time till 1870 the
persecution was destined to rage with unabated fury and the
French estimated the number killed at 8,000. The hardships
and sufferings of this time are second to none in the history
of religious persecutions. Hundreds fled to the mountains
and there starved or froze to death. The tales of that terrible
time remind one of the persecutions under the Roman
Emperors or the no less terrible scenes of the Spanish Inquisition.</p>

<p class='c000'>But to return to 1866. There were other events of interest
transpiring. The pet scheme of the Regent to build his
son a new palace was being worked out. The palace was in
process of erection, when suddenly the funds gave out. Here
the Regent committed his next great blunder. This time it
was in the realm of finance. He entertained the fallacy that
he could meet a deficit by coining money. Of course the
only way to meet a deficit in this way was to debase the currency.
He did it on a grand scale when he once determined
upon it, for whereas the people had from time immemorial
used a one-cash piece, he began to mint a hundred-cash piece
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>which was actually less than fifty cash in weight. One of
these was given as a day’s wage to each of the workmen on the
palace. This coin bore on its face the legend “The great
Finance Hundred Cash Piece,” but it proved to be very small
finance indeed, for of course its issue was immediately followed
by an enormous rise in the price of all commodities, and
rice went up two hundred per cent. The government was
thus plunged deeper in the mire than ever; but the Regent
had set his will on this thing and was determined to carry it
through at any cost. His next move, taken in the following
year, was to bring in old, discarded, Chinese cash literally by
the cart-load, across the border. This he had bought in
China at auction prices and forced on the people as legal
tender. At the same time he forced the people to work in
gangs of 300 at a time on the palace without pay. In this
way the work was finished, but it is safe to say that to this
day the country has not recovered from the effects of that
mad financiering. Wealthy citizens were called upon to
make donations to the building fund, and this gained the
<a id='corr212.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>soubriquet</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_212.19'>soubriquet</a></span> of “The Free-will Offering.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The year 1868, which meant so much for Japan, was not
otherwise signalised in Korea than by a demand on the part
of Russia that Korean refugees beyond the border be recalled.
It also beheld the publication of the work “The Six Departments
and their Duties.” In September alone 2,000
Christians were killed, five hundred of them being residents
of Seoul.</p>

<p class='c000'>The United States had not forgotten the fate of the “General
Sherman.” She had no intention of letting the matter
drop. In the early spring of 1871 minister Frederick F. Low,
at Peking, received instructions from his government to go in
company with Rear-admiral Rodgers to the shores of Korea
and attempt to conclude a treaty relative to the treatment of
American seamen who might be cast upon the shores of that
country. He was also instructed to try to make a trade convention
with Korea looking toward the opening of Korea to
foreign commerce. The fleet consisted of the war vessels
<em>Colorado</em>, <em>Alaska</em>, <em>Bernicia</em>, <em>Monocacy</em>, and <em>Palos</em>. These vessels
rendezvoused at Nagasaki and on May sixteenth they
set sail for Korea. Minister Low’s correspondence with his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>government shows that he had accurately gauged the probabilities
of the situation. A long acquaintance with the Korean
could not have rendered his diagnosis of the case more accurate
than it was. From the very first he considered it to
be a hopeless case, and he was right. But this in no way lessened
the care he exercised in doing every thing in his power
to render the expedition a success. After fourteen days of
struggle against dense fogs, tortuous channels and swift tidal
currents the fleet dropped anchor off the islands known as the
Ferrierre group, not far from Eugénie Island. This was on
May 30th. They had not been there long before they were
boarded by some small officials with whom Minister Low was
of course unable to treat, but through them he sent a friendly
message to Seoul asking that an official of equal rank with the
American envoy be sent to confer with him on important
matters. The Koreans had already received through the
Chinese an intimation of what the Americans desired but they
argued that as their policy of carrying ship-wrecked mariners
safely across the border was well known abroad and as they
did not care to open up relations with other countries, there
was no call to send an envoy to treat with the Americans.
The Regent shrewdly, though mistakenly, suspected that the
“General Sherman” affair was at the bottom of this, as the
death of the French priests had been the cause of the French
expedition and he decided to garrison Kang-wha and deal
with the Americans as he had with the French. Gen. O-Yo-jŭn
was sent with 3,000 troops to Kwang Fort on the island
of Kang-wha. A part of this force was stationed as garrison
at Tok-chin, a little fort at the narrowest part of the estuary
between Kang-wha and the mainland, where the tide runs
through with tremendous force and a dangerous reef adds to
the difficulty of navigation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus it was that when the <em>Monocacy</em> and <em>Palos</em> steamed
slowly up the channel on a tour of inspection they were fired
upon by the guns of this little fort. No special damage was
done, and as soon as the gunboats could be gotten ready to
reply to this <a id='corr213.37'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='uexpected'>unexpected</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_213.37'>unexpected</a></span> assault they opened fire upon the little
fort and <a id='corr213.38'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='spedily'>speedily</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_213.38'>speedily</a></span> drove its garrison out. The Koreans supposed
these gunboats were approaching for the purpose of assault.
Indeed, as no intimation had been given the Korean government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>that such a reconnoitering expedition was planned, and
as this narrow passage was considered the main gateway of
approach to the capital, the Koreans argued strictly from the
book and the American contention that the attack was unprovoked
was groundless, for to Korean eyes the very approach
to this stronghold was abundant provocation.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the fort had been silenced, the two gunboats
steamed back to the main anchorage and reported. It was
instantly decided that an apology must be forthcoming from
the government, but as none came, retaliation was the only
thing left to vindicate the wounded honor of the United
States. A strong force was despatched, which, under cover
of the ship’s guns was landed near the fort, and after a hard
hand to hand struggle in which every man of the garrison
was killed at his post the place was taken. Thus was the
tarnished honor of the Great Republic restored to its former
brightness. But mark the sequel. The Admiral plainly was
entirely unequal to the task of pushing the matter to the
gates of Seoul, and so he withdrew and sailed away to China
exactly as the French had done. The great mistake in this
lay in ignorance of the Korean character. The government
cared little for the loss of a few earth-works on Kang-wha.
In fact, even if the Americans had overrun and ravaged half
the peninsula and yet had not unseated the king in his
capital or endangered his person, their departure would have
left the Koreans in the firm belief that the foreigners had
been whipped. In the last decade of the twelfth century the
Japanese overran the country, forced the King to flee to the
very banks of the Yalu, killed hundreds of thousands of the
people and for seven years waged equal war in the peninsula,
and yet when Hideyoshi died and his troops were recalled
Korea claimed that the Japanese had been defeated; and it
was true. The approach of United States gunboats up to
the very walls of the “Gibraltar” of Korea was nothing less
than a declaration of war, and the paltry loss of the little
garrison was a cheap price to pay for their ultimate triumph
in seeing the American ships “hull down” in the Yellow sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>When this glad news was published in Seoul the already
plethoric pride of the Regent swelled to bursting. Another
brilliant victory had been scored.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Another of the great powers of the West had been humbled.
Korea could show her great patron China how to
handle the barbarians. He immediately ordered the erection
in the center of the city of a monument which had been in
preparation since 1866. The inscription ran as follows.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Western Barbarians have attacked and injured us,
with a view either to making war upon us or to forcing treaties
upon us. If we consent to the latter it will mean the betrayal
of the country. Let our descendants to the ten thousandth
generation bear this in mind. Made in the Pyöng-in Year
and set up in the Sin-mi Year.”</p>

<p class='c000'>All the court and the nobility vied with each other in
congratulating the regent upon the completion of this work
and declared that the people were pleased with the prospect
of excluding all foreigners and preserving the time-honored
seclusion of the land.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to understand the interesting train of events
that transpired in 1873 it will be necessary to go back and review
the relations that existed between Korea and Japan.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the close of the Japanese invasion an arrangement had
been arrived at between Japan and Korea by the terms of
which the Japanese placed a number of traders at Fusan.
The popular belief of the Koreans that the government accepted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>these as hostages in place of an annual tribute of three
<a id='corr216.2a'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='undred'>hundred</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_216.2a'>hundred</a></span> Japanese female hides is an amusing fiction which <a id='corr216.2b'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='ish'>is</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_216.2b'>is</a></span>
intended to offset the ignominy of the ear and nose monument
in Kyoto.</p>

<p class='c000'>This colony was called the Su-ja-ri or “Frontier Guard.”
The Korean government appropriated ten million cash a year
to its support. The Japanese claim that these people were
not hostages but were merchants and were placed there to
form a commercial <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">point d’appui</span></em> between the two countries.
That the money paid for their support was of the nature of a
tribute is neither claimed by the Japanese nor admitted by the
Koreans; in fact the terms always used in describing these
payments implies the coördinate degree of the recipient.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Japanese colony was continued up to the year 1869
without intermission but it was not destined to remain undisturbed.
No sooner had the Imperial government become
established in Japan than the Emperor appointed a commission
to approach the Korean government through the time-honored
avenue of approach, namely Fusan and the prefect
of Tong-nă, with a view to establishing closer commercial and
diplomatic relations. This commissioner transacted the business
through the Daimyo of Tsushima who sent the Imperial
letter to the prefect of Tong-nă and asked that it be transmitted
to the capital. After reading it the prefect refused to
send it, on the plea that whereas Japan had always addressed
Korea in terms of respect she now adopted a tone of superiority
and called herself an Empire. The envoy urged that
Japan had recently undergone a complete change, that she
had adopted Western ideas and had centralised her government,
and urged that the missive must be sent on to Seoul.
The prefect was prevailed upon to copy the letter and send it
on to the Regent but the Reply came back forthwith “We
will not receive the Japanese letter. Drive the envoy away.”
The following year the annual grant of rice was suddenly
discontinued without a word of warning and the Japanese in
Fusan were greatly exercised thereby. They made a loud
outcry and their government made repeated attempts to come
to an understanding with the Korean government but without
success.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was in 1870 that the Japanese Hanabusa, called Wha-bang
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>Eui-jil by the Koreans, came with an urgent request
that a treaty of commerce be signed, but he was likewise unsuccessful.
The King, however, was nearing the age when
the Regent must hand over to him the reins of power and the
Queen, a woman of natural ability and of imperious will, was
gathering about her a faction which was wholly inimical to the
plans and the tactics of the Regent. The latter found to his
chagrin that the woman whom he had placed on the throne
with his son with special reference to the cementing of his
own power was likely to become the instrument of his undoing.
Sure it is that in spite of the hatred which the Regent
evinced against the Japanese this same Hanabusa came to
Seoul in 1871 or early in 1872, in a quite unofficial manner,
and was given quarters at the palace where he was in constant
communication with the Queen and the members of her
faction, and where, by exhibiting curious objects of western
manufacture, such as a toy telephone and the like, he amused
his royal patroness and won his way into the favor of the
party that was shortly to step into the place made vacant by
the retiring Regent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The queen’s faction were diametrically opposed to the
most cherished prejudices of the Regent. They favored, or at
least looked with complacency upon, the growth of Roman
Catholicism, they favored the policy of listening to China’s
advice in the matter of foreign relations. They were doubtless
urged in this direction partly by pure opposition to the
Regent and partly by the representations of the Japanese who
had gained the ear of royalty. The palace was the scene of
frequent and violent altercations between the heads of these
two factions, but an open rupture did not occur until the year
1873 when an official named Ch‘oe Ik-hyŭn memorialised the
throne speaking disparagingly of the presence of the Japanese
in the palace and, toward the end, charging the Regent with
indirection in the use of the public funds. The king had for
some time been growing restive under the control of the Regent,
being led to some extent by the new party of which the
queen was the patroness and at whose head stood her brother,
Min Seung-ho. The memorial was received with marks of
approval by the king and he immediately cut off a large part
of the revenues of the Regent. At the same time Min Seung-ho
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>approached the Regent’s son, Yi Chă-myŭn, elder brother to
the king, and suggested that if the Regent could be removed
they two might share the leadership of affairs. The young
man accepted the offer and ranged himself in line with the
opposition. The Regent was now in great straits. The combination
against him had proved too strong, and in the last
moon of 1873 he shook off the dust of Seoul from his feet and
retired to Ka-p‘yŭng, thirty-five miles to the east of the capital.
After five months of residence there he returned as far
as the village of Ko-deung ten miles to the north-east of
Seoul.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the people there was still a strong element that
favored the ex-Regent. They missed a strong personality at
the helm of state, for the Koreans have always preferred a
strong even if tyrannical leadership. In recognition of this
sentiment it was deemed wise to put the ex-Regent’s brother,
whom he had always kept severely in the back-ground, in the
prominent if not necessarily important position of Prime Minister.
He proved as was intended a mere puppet in the hands
of the Min party who by this time had absorbed the whole
power of the government. He was allowed, in compensation
for this, to control the sale of public offices to his own profit,
but always under the vigilant eye of the dominant faction.</p>

<p class='c000'>A new era in the metamorphosis of Korea had now begun.
Public affairs in the peninsula took a new direction. Min
Seung-ho was court favorite and it looked as if matters would
soon settle down to something like their former tranquility.
But the latter days of the year were destined to bring a severe
shock to the leaders of the new party. One day Min Seung-ho
received a letter purporting to be from a certain party
with whom he was on intimate terms, and with it came a casket
wrapped in silk. He was requested to open it only in the
presence of his mother and his son. Late at night in his inner
chamber he opened it in the presence of these members of his
family, but when he lifted the cover the casket exploded with
terrific force killing the three instantly and setting the house on
fire. As Min Seung-ho had but one enemy bold enough to
perpetrate the deed the popular belief that it was done by his
great rival is practically undisputed, though no direct evidence
perhaps exists.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Min T‘ă-ho immediately stepped into the place made vacant
by the terrible death of the favorite. Soon after this the
government discontinued the use of the 100 cash pieces with
which the Regent had diluted the currency of the country. In
the second moon of 1874 the crown prince was born. The
year was also signalised by the remittance in perpetuity of the
tax on real estate in and about the city of Seoul.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1875 three of the ex-Regent’s friends, led by Cho
Ch‘ung-sik, memorialised the throne begging that the Prince
Tai-wŭn be again reinstated in power. For this rash act they
were all condemned to death, and it was only by the personal
intercession of the ex-Regent that the sentence was commuted
to banishment for life. Even so, Cho Ch‘ung-sik was killed
at his place of exile.</p>

<p class='c000'>In September the Japanese man-of-war <em>Unyo Kwan</em>, after
making a trip to Chefoo, approached the island of Kang-wha
to make soundings. Approaching the town of Yöng-jŭng,
they sent a small boat ashore to look for water. As they
neared the town they were suddenly fired upon by the Koreans
in the little fortress, who evidently took them for Frenchmen
or Americans. A moment later the small boat was turned
about and was making toward the man-of-war again. The commander
gave instant orders for summary punishment to be
inflicted for this perfectly <a id='corr219.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='uprovoked'>unprovoked</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_219.24'>unprovoked</a></span> assault. He opened
fire on the town and soon silenced the batteries. A strong
body of marines was landed which put the garrison to flight,
seized all the arms and provisions and fired the town. The
man-of-war then steamed away to Nagasaki to report what
had occurred.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this time there were in Japan two parties who took
radically different views of the Korean question. One of these
parties, led by Saigo of Satsuma, smarting under the insulting
way in which Korea had received the Japanese overtures,
would listen to nothing but instant war. The other party,
which saw more clearly the vital points in the question at issue,
urged peaceful measures. The policy of the latter prevailed
and it was decided to send an embassy to attempt the
ratification of a treaty, and if that failed war was to be the alternative.
This peace policy was so distasteful to the war
party that Saigo returned to Satsuma and began to set in motion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>those agencies which resulted in the sanguinary Satsuma
Rebellion.</p>

<p class='c000'>For many centuries there had been a strip of <a id='corr220.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='nautral'>neutral</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_220.3'>neutral</a></span> territory
between the Korean border, the Yalu River, and the
Chinese border which was marked by a line of stakes. This
strip of land naturally became the hiding <a id='corr220.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='plece'>place</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_220.6'>place</a></span> of refugees
and criminals from both countries, for here they were free
from police supervision whether Korean or Chinese. The
statesman Li Hung-chang recognized this to be a menace to
the <a id='corr220.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>wellfare</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_220.10'>wellfare</a></span> of both countries and took steps to put an end to
it, by sending a strong body of troops who, in conjunction
with a gunboat, succeeded in breaking up the nest of desperadoes
and rendering the country fit for colonisation. Two
years later this strip of land was definitely connected with
China and the two countries again faced each other across the
waters of the <a id='corr220.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Yalu,'>Yalu.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_220.16'>Yalu.</a></span></p>

<p class='c000'>The Korean attack upon the Unyo Kwan off Kang-wha
proved the lever which finally roused Japan to active steps in
regard to the opening of Korea. The war party regarded it
as their golden opportunity, while the peace party believed it
would pave the way for a peaceful accomplishment of their
purpose. An envoy was despatched to Peking to sound the
policy of that government. The Chinese, fearing that they
would be held responsible for the misdoings of Korea denied,
all responsibility and virtually acknowledged the independence
of the peninsula. At the same time a military and naval expedition
under Kiroda Kiyotaku, seconded by Inouye Bunda,
sailed for Kang-wha with a fleet of gunboats, containing in all
some 800 men. The Chinese had already advised the Korean
government to make terms with the Japanese, and this in fact
was the wish of the dominant party; so, when the Japanese
demand reached Seoul, that commissioners be sent to Kang-wha
to treat with the visitors the government quickly complied.
Two high officials. Sin Hön and Yun Cha-seung, were
despatched to Kang-wha and the first definite step was taken
toward casting off the old time isolation policy, the fond dream
of the ex-Regent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Japanese envoy opened the conference by asking
why the Koreans had given no answer to the repeated requests
of the Japanese for the consummation of a treaty of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>peace and friendship. The Korean commissioner replied that
from the very earliest times Japan had always addressed
Korea in respectful language, but that now she had arrogated to
herself the title of Great Japan and called her ruler the
Great Emperor. This seemed to imply the vassalage of
Korea, an entirely new role for her to play. The Japanese replied
that the mere assumption of the name of empire on the
part of Japan implied nothing as to the status of Korea one
way or the other. This seemed to satisfy the Koreans.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Japanese <a id='corr221.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='than'>then</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_221.10'>then</a></span> asked why they had been fired upon
at Yŭng-jŭng. The answer was that the Japanese were dressed
in European clothes and were therefore mistaken for
Europeans. But when the Japanese asked why the Koreans
had not recognized the Japanese flag, especially since the
Japanese government had been careful to send copies of their
flag to Korea and ask that one be sent to each of the prefectures
throughout the land, the Korean commissioners could
find nothing to say and had to confess that they had been
in error.</p>

<p class='c000'>All these things were duly reported to the authorities in
Seoul where daily councils were being held to discuss the important
questions. The ex-Regent sent an urgent appeal to
the ministers not to make a treaty, but the tide had turned,
and after some sharp discussion as to how the two governments
should be designated in the treaty it was finally ratified
on <a id='corr221.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Febuary'>February</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_221.26'>February</a></span> 27th 1876, and Korea was a hermit no longer.
Three months later a semi official envoy was sent to Japan in
the person of Kim Keui-su.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile the closing days of 1875 had beheld a curious
event in Seoul. In the dead of night the house of Yi Ch’oe-eung,
the Prime Minister and the brother of the ex-Regent,
was set on fire by an unknown hand and burned to the ground.
None of the inmates were injured. The culprit was seized
and under torture confessed that one Sin Ch’ŭl-gyun had hired
him to do the work. Sin was therefore seized and put to
death as a traitor. Whether he was indeed guilty and if so
whether he was but an agent in the business are questions
that have never been answered.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not until the sixth moon of 1879 that, in pursuance
of the new treaty, a Japanese Minister, Hanabusa,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>was sent to represent his government at Seoul. We will remember
that he had already served his government most successfully
at the Korean capital in a private capacity. The
new legation was situated at the Ch’ŭn Yŭn-jŭng near the
lotus pond outside the West Gate. At almost the very same
time two French priests arrived in Seoul and took up their
quarters outside this same gate and began to proselyte.
They were forthwith seized by the authorities, and were for
some time in imminent danger. There was however a strong
feeling in the government that this was inconsistent with the
new role that it had elected to play and that it was distinctly
dangerous. A halt was called and the Japanese Minister took
advantage of it to inform the authorities that he had received
a message from the French Minister in Tokyo asking him to
use his good offices in behalf of these endangered men.
The Minister added his own advice that the Korean
government should hand over the imprisoned men at once.
This was done and the Japanese Minister forwarded them
to Japan.</p>

<p class='c000'>One year later, in the summer of 1880, Kim Hong-jip,
a man of progressive tendencies, went to Japan. Soon after
arriving there he met a Chinaman who seems to have made
a strong impression on him. This Chinaman had many talks
with him and gave him a long manuscript dealing with the
subject of Korea’s foreign relations, which he asked should
be transmitted to the king of Korea. In it he advised the
cementing of friendship with the United States, China and
Japan, but he spoke disparagingly of Russia. It mentioned
Protestant Christianity as being the basis of Western greatness
and advised that its propagation be encouraged. It compared
the division of Christianity into Roman Catholic and
Protestant to the division of Confucianism into the two sects
Chu-ja and Yuk-sang-san. When Kim Hong-jip brought
this manuscript and placed it in the hands of the king it created
a profound sensation, and awakened the bitterest opposition.
Many advised that he be killed as an introducer of
Christianity. The most violent of all were Yi Man-son,
Hong Chă-hak and Păk Nak-kwan who memorialized the
throne urging the execution of Kim and the overthrow of all
Christian work in the peninsula. This met with the severest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>censure from the king, not because it was in itself seditious
but because it was an attempt to reinstate the policy of the
Regency. Yi Man-son was banished, Hong Chă-hak was executed
and Păk Nak-kwan was imprisoned. This put an
end to anti-Christian talk for the time being and it was
never again seriously raised.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the fourth moon of 1881 the progressive tendencies of
the new regime had made such headway that the king determined
to send a commission to Japan to look about and see
something of the world, from which Korea had been so carefully
secluded. For this purpose His Majesty selected Cho
Chun-Yŭng, Pak Chöng-yang, Sim Sang hak, Cho Pyŭng-jik,
Min Chong-muk. O Yun jung, Om Se-yŭng, Kang Mun-hŭng,
Hong Yŭng-sik, Yi Wŭn-whe, and Yi Pong-eui. These men
immediately took passage for Japan. At the same time a
party of young men was sent to Tientsin under the chaperonage
of Kim Yun-sik on a similar errand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Late in this year, 1881, four of the adherents of the ex-Regent
conspired to overthrow the government, dethrone the
king and put in his place Yi Chă-sŭn, a son of the ex-Regent
by a concubine. The ex-Regent was then to be brought
back to power. The last day of the eighth moon was set for
the consummation of this plot. But on the day before, Nam-Myŭng
sŭn and Yi P’ung-nă divulged the whole scheme to
the favorite Min T’ă-ho, and as a result the four arch-conspirators
were seized on the morning of the day set for the
culmination of the plot and within a few days eleven others
were taken. In the eleventh moon they were all beheaded,
and at the same time Yi Chă-sŭn was given poison and expired.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time a real liberal party had begun to form. Its
leading spirits were Kim Ok-kyun, Pak Yŭng-hyo, So Kwang-bom,
Hong Yŭng-sik, Yi To-jă, Sin Keui-sŭn and Pak Yŭng-kyo.
These were all men of very high family and held important
positions under the government. They were in favor
of the immediate opening of Korea to intercourse with foreign
powers and the establishment of reforms such as had been effected
in Japan. The king was largely influenced by the progressive
policy mapped out by these men and an era of rapid
advancement seemed to be dawning. A special department
was established called the Ki-mu or Machinery Bureau which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>was to take charge of the introduction of foreign machinery
and implements of all kinds.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is important to note the position of the Min faction at
this point. It was with the downfall of the Regent that,
through the queen’s influence, the Min faction sprang to life.
With the utmost celerity all government positions were filled
with them or their sympathizers and it seemed sure that they
would have a long lease of official life. The extreme opposition
of the Regent to all reforms and to the opening of the
country to foreign intercourse naturally inclined his rivals in
that very direction and it was directly through the Min faction
that the policy of non-seclusion was inaugurated. The
queen likewise was in favor of opening up the country to the
civilizing influences of the West. But with the Min faction,
as a whole, the question of national policy were entirely
secondary to the one main idea of preserving the ascendency
which they had gained. Here is the key to all that followed.
The Mins were not at that time facing China-ward and they
never would have been had it not become necessary in order
to preserve the enviable position they occupied. As we have
seen, a number of high officials who had imbibed something
of the spirit of reform which had permeated Japan were filling
the ear of the king and queen with plans for reform.
They were meeting with a favorable hearing and in proportion
as they succeeded, the power of the Mins must wane; not
because the latter disliked the idea of opening up Korea but
because it was another faction that had the work in hand, and
that faction would naturally attain more and more power at
court as success crowned their efforts. It was just here that
the difficulty began. If the liberal leaders had been willing
to put the working out of the plan into the hands of the Min
faction all might have gone along smoothly and Korea might
have realized some of the hopes of the would-be reformers.
But such self-abnegation could scarcely be expected from men
who saw in the carrying out of their brilliant scheme not only
rewards for themselves but the advancement of the country.
The personal element was present in full force and this was
the rock on which the reformation of Korea split. We may
believe that it was at this point that the Min faction determined
its policy, a policy that led it straight into the arms of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>China. From this point it became not the progressive party
but the conservative party. Its leading members were Min
T’ă-ho, Min Yŭng-muk, Min Tu-ho, Han Kyu-jik and Cho
Ryŭng-ha. There was one of the Mins however who held
with the liberal party, for a time at least. This was Min
Yŭng-ik, nephew to the queen, adopted son of Min Seung-ho
who had been killed by the infernal machine in 1874. That
this man took his stand at first with the liberals is shown by
the fact that in the spring of 1882 he joined Kim Hong-jip,
Kim Ok-kyun, Hong Yŭng-sik and other liberal leaders in
advising the king to select 200 young men and engage a Japanese
instructor to drill them in military tactics. The advice
was followed, and Lieutenant Isobayachi was employed for
that purpose. Without delay he began work at the Ha-do-gam
near the East Gate. At the same time a number of
young men were sent to Japan to study military matters.
Among these the most prominent was Sŭ Chă-p’il who was intimately
connected with the liberal movement, though at that
time he was too young to take a prominent part.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first regularly appointed Minister to the Japanese was
Pak Yŭng-hyo the liberal leader. In the early part of 1882
he departed on his mission. It was at Chemulpo on board
the little Japanese steamer that the Korean flag was first
designed. Pak Yŭng-hyo, Kim Ok-kyun, Sŭ Kwang-bom and
Sŭ Chă-p’il were all present when it was hoisted for the first
time in honor of the first Minister to Japan.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the two <a id='corr225.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='hunderd'>hundred</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_225.27'>hundred</a></span> men who were being drilled at
the Ha-do-gam were being plentifully fed and clothed by the
government, the 3,700 troops, called the Hul lyŭn To-gam,
the former Royal Guard, were being badly neglected. Their
pay was two or three months in arrears and for a similar period
they had not received a grain of rice. They were naturally
incensed and there were angry mutterings against the two
hundred men who were being treated so much better than
they. When the king was made aware of this he ordered
that a month’s allowance of rice be given out to these discontented
troops. This work was put into the hands of Min
Kyŭm-ho the overseer of the government finances, and he in
turn handed the matter over to his major-domo who, it appears,
sold the good rice and with the proceeds bought a large quantity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>of the poorest quality which he mixed with sand and
doled out to the hungry troops. The result may be imagined.
They congregated in various places and determined that since
they must die in any event they would rather die fighting
than starving. They strengthened the feeble-hearted among
their own number by threats of death in case any proved unfaithful
and refused to assist in the work in hand. On the
night of the ninth of the sixth moon, in the midst of heavily
falling rain, they arose <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en masse</em></span> and proceeded to their general’s
house, where they announced that they were going to
take revenge on those who had wronged them. That they
not only did not attack him but that they even had the courtesy
to go and tell him what they were about to do shows
clearly that he was in no wise to blame for the ill-treatment
they had received. They also sent a messenger to the ex-Regent,
but the purport of the message is not known. They
then hastened to the residence of Min Kyŭm-ho, but he had
heard of the trouble and had fled to the royal presence for protection.
The infuriated soldiery vented their rage on the
property by tearing down the house and destroying the furniture.
They seized the dishonest major-domo and beat him to
death upon the spot. The sight of this aroused all their worst
instincts and, separating into bands of two or three hundred,
they hastened to different parts of the town to complete what
had been begun. Some ran to the prisons and liberated the
inmates who naturally joined the ranks of the rioters. One of
these prisoners was Păk Nak-kwan who had memorialized the
throne in favor of the ex-Regent. They took him on their
shoulders and rushed through the streets shouting “Păk
Chung-sin” or “Păk the patriot.” For this, a few months
later he was torn to pieces by bullocks outside the West Gate.
Part of the mob went to the Ha-do-gam, but on their approach
the Japanese military instructor took to his heels and made
for the Japanese Legation. But he was overtaken and cut
down in the streets. Another detachment hastened to the
Japanese Legation itself, but found the gates shut and barred.
Within were nine Japanese. In order to make it light enough
to carry on their dastardly work the assaulting mob threw
firebrands over the wall and thus illuminated the place, for
it was night. The little company of Japanese soon became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>aware that they could not hope to stand a siege and that their
only hope lay in a bold dash. Suddenly the gates flew open
and the nine determined men rushed out brandishing their
swords and firing their revolvers straight into the crowd. The
Koreans were taken wholly by surprise and beat a hasty retreat.
In their headlong flight many of them fell into the
lotus pond adjoining. As the Japanese hurried along to the
governor’s yamen which was not far away, they cut down a
few of the mob. They found that the governor had gone to
the palace and so they turned their faces toward Chemulpo
and hastened away. Another party of the insurgents went
outside the city to various monasteries which they burned to
the ground. The most important of these was the Sin-heung
Monastery outside the Northeast Gate. This move was dictated
by hate of the Min faction whose patroness was known
to be very well affected toward Buddhism and to have made
friends with the monks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other parties scattered over the city carrying the torch to
the door of every member of the Min faction. The houses
of Min Kyŭm-ho, Min T’ă-ho, Min Yŭng-ik, Min Yŭng-so,
Min Yŭng-jun, <a id='corr227.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Min Yŭng-ju'>Min Yŭng-ju,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_227.21'>Min Yŭng-ju,</a></span> Min Ch’ang-sik, Prince Heung-in,
Kim Po-hyŭn and Yun Chă-dŭk were torn down by the use
of long ropes. The furniture was piled in a great heap in the
street and burned. The only member of the Min clan however
that was seized that night was Min Ch’ang-sik who lived
at Kon-dang-kol. He had the unenviable reputation of having
taken large sums of money from the people by indirection.
When he was seized he cried “I am not a Min; my name is
Păk.” They bound him and carried him through the streets
shouting “Is this a Min or a Păk?” The populace answered
fiercely “He is a Min.” So they took him down to the big
bell and stabbed him in a hundred places with their swords
and cut his mouth from ear to ear.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the morning of the tenth broke Seoul was in a terrible
condition. Bands of frenzied soldiery were ranging
through the streets. The people either huddled about their
fireplaces with barred doors or else sought safety in flight
from the city. At last the mob rendezvoused in front of the
palace gate and finding no opposition they boldly entered.
Rushing into the inner court of the king’s private apartments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>they found themselves face to face with His Majesty. About him
stood a few of the officials who had not fled the city. There
were Min Kyŭm-ho, Kim Po-hyŭn, Cho Ryŭng-ha and Prince
Heung-in. Rushing forward the soldiers struck their swords
against the floor and the door-posts and demanded that these
men be handed over to them. It was quite evident that there
was no escape and that by refusal they would only endanger
the king’s life. So these men made obeisance to His Majesty
and then stepped down into the hands of the soldiers. Min
Kyŭm-ho and Kim Po-hyŭn were instantly struck down and
hacked in pieces before the very eyes of the king. Of Kim
nothing remained but the trunk of his body. Cho Ryŭng-ha
was spared but Prince Heung-in died the same day for he was
mashed to a jelly by the gun-stocks of the soldiers.</p>

<p class='c000'>This done, the soldiers demanded the person of the queen.
The king sternly demanded how they dared ask of him the
person of his Queen. Without answering they rushed away
to her private apartments. Seizing palace women by the
hair they dragged them about demanding where their mistress
was. But while this was going on one of the palace guard
named Hong Cha-heui entered the Queen’s presence and said
that she was in danger and that her only hope of escape lay
in getting on his back and being carried out. This she instantly
did. A skirt was hastily thrown over her head and
the heroic man took her straight out through the midst
of the infuriated soldiery. Some of them seized hold of him
and demanded whom he was carrying. He replied that it
was one of the palace women, his sister, whom he was conveying
to a place of safety. His heroism was rewarded by
seeing her safely outside the palace and comfortably housed
at the residence of Yun T‘ă-jŭn to the west of the palace.
The next day she was taken in a closed chair toward the village
of Chang-wŭn in the district of Ch‘ung-ju in Ch’ung ch‘ŭng
Province, where she arrived several days later. In that
place she found refuge in the house of Min Eung-sik. This
journey was made not along the main road but along by-paths
among the mountains, and it is said that Hong Cha-heui lost
several of his toes as a result of this terrible march, for shoes
could not be procured.</p>

<p class='c000'>But we must return to the palace. The ex-Regent appeared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>on the scene while the solders were still raging
through the palace in search of the Queen. He gave the
signal to stop, and instantly the soldiers obeyed and quietly
left the palace. That these soldiers, worked up as they were
to a perfect frenzy, should have obeyed the commands of the
Prince Tai-wŭn so instantly and implicitly would seem to
argue a closer connection with this outbreak than any overt
act on his part would give us warrant to affirm.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ex-Regent was now in power again. He supposed
that the Queen had been killed, and on the next day he
summoned the officials and said that though the Queen was
dead yet her body had not been found; they must therefore
take some of her clothing and perform the funeral rites with
them instead. The proclamation went forth, and from the
middle of the sixth moon the people went into mourning for
their Queen.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few days after the flight of the Queen a rumor was
circulated to the effect that a large body of men belonging to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>the peddlar’s guild had congregated outside the East Gate
and were about to enter and loot the city. A panic seized
the people, and men, women and children might be seen flying
in all directions, some out into the neighboring country
and some up the steep sides of the surrounding mountains.
The gates being all locked the people forced the South Gate
and the two West gates and thus made good their escape.
The king himself was affected by the rumor and leaving the
palace sought safety at the house of Yi Che-wan. But the
panic ceased as quickly as it had begun, and within three
hours the people were returning to their homes again. The
extreme haste with which the people tried to get away
is illustrated in the case of one old man who seized his
little grand-son, as he supposed by the hand, and fled up a
mountain but found to his dismay that he had taken the boy
by the leg rather than by the hand and that the little fellow
had succumbed to this harsh treatment.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the fifth of the seventh moon Count Inouye arrived
in Chemulpo as Japanese envoy and immediately sent word
to have a high Korean official sent to Chemulpo to discuss the
situation. Kim Hong-jip was sent, and as a result the Korean
government was asked to pay an indemnity for the lives of
the Japanese who had been killed. It appears that besides
the Japanese military instructor five or six others had been
killed, also a considerable amount of Japanese money had
been seized and destroyed at the Japanese headquarters.
The indemnity was placed at a million cash apiece for the
Japanese who had fallen. This amounted to something like
$2,500 each, a ridiculously small sum, but perhaps all the
Japanese thought they could get. The ex-Regent replied
that if the Japanese demanded this indemnity the Korean
government would feel obliged to levy a tax upon all Japanese
merchants doing business in Korea. This was practically
a refusal to pay the indemnity and the envoy took his departure.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hardly had he left before a Chinese force 3,000 strong arrived
at Nam-yang off the town of Su-wŭn. They were commanded
by Generals O Chang-gyŭng, Wang Sŭk-ch’ang, Ma
Kŭn-sang and by a lesser officer named Wŭn Se-gă who was
destined to play a leading part from this time on. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>troops came, it can hardly be doubted, at the request
of the conservative party and it was from this hour that
that faction turned unreservedly towards China and gave the
latter occasion for beginning a series of encroachments
upon Korea’s practical independence which ended in the
China-Japan war. These troops encamped all about the
capital, some at Pă-o-gă outside the West Gate and some at
the Ha-do-gam just inside the East Gate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the soldiers who had been most active in creating
the disturbance lived at Wang-sim-yi three miles outside
the East Gate. The Chinese made it their first work to seize
these men by night. Ten of them were court-martialed and
were torn to pieces by bullocks.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chinese general O Jang-gyŭng was told that the ex-Regent
was at the bottom of the emeute, and he sent a letter
informing the Emperor of this fact. The latter ordered him
to seize the person of the offending party and bring him to
China. The Chinese general thereupon visited the palace
where the Prince Tai-wŭn was in full control and invited him
to visit Yong-san on the river, where he said there was something
important for him to see. Having once gotten him on
board a Chinese boat there, under pretext of showing him
over it, the anchor was quickly raised and the baffled Prince
found himself on his way to China. When he arrived at
Tientsin he was refused audience with Li Hung-chang but
was banished by imperial decree to a place not far from
Tientsin, where he was well cared for until his return to
Korea three years later.</p>

<p class='c000'>After this <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">deus ex machina</span></em> had spirited the ex-Regent
away, an official, So Sang-jo, memorialized the throne stating
that the Queen was still alive and ought to be brought back
to the capital. It is said that Yi Yŭng-ik covered the space
between the capital and her place of hiding, sixty-three
miles, in a single day, carrying the message of recall. A
large retinue of officials and soldiers were sent southward
and brought the Queen back to Seoul where she arrived on
the first day of the eighth moon. The people immediately
doffed their mourning garb.</p>

<p class='c000'>Toward the close of 1882 a Foreign Office was established
in the capital and Kim Yun-sik was made Minister of Foreign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>Affairs. He invited P. G. von Mollendorf, a member of the
customs staff of China, to act as adviser, and the Chinese
generals Wang Sŭk-ch’ang and Ma Kŭn-sang were made attaches
of the new department.</p>

<p class='c000'>The year 1883 witnessed more advance in Korea than
any year before or since. In May Gen. Foote, the first United
States Minister, arrived and on the nineteenth of that month
the treaty which had been drawn up at Chemulpo between
Commodore Shufeldt and the Korean Commissioners was ratified.
After this was done Gen. Foote left Korea to make
preparations for the establishment of a legation in Seoul.</p>

<p class='c000'>Kim Ok-kyun, one of the leading members of the progressive
party was made “Whale Catching Commissioner”
and departed for Japan to fit out an expedition to carry on
this lucrative government monopoly along the Korean coast.
He was selected for this work because of his intimate acquaintance
with the Japanese. It was a move looking toward
the development of Korea’s resources and was therefore
in direct line with the wishes and plans of the progressionists.
At about the same time a powder-mill was built outside
the Northwest Gate, and a foreign mint was erected inside
the Little West Gate. This was done with the aid of
Japanese experts at a great and, as it proved, useless expense
to the government. An office was founded for the
printing and dissemination of useful literature on the subjects
of agriculture, forestry, stock-raising and the like. The
ports of Chemulpo and Wŭn-san were opened to foreign trade
according to the stipulation of the Japanese and American
treaties. In contrast to the progressive moves we find that
eight men who were suspected of complicacy with the ex-Regent
in the emeute of the preceding year were executed by
poison. Of like character was the building of the Kwan-wang
temple, devoted to the interests of sorceresses and
exorcists who enjoyed the patronage of the Queen.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the summer of 1883 Min Yŭng-ik was made special
envoy to the United States. His second was Hong Yŭng-sik.
Among his suite were Sŭ Kwang-bom, Pak Un and
others, all of whom were members of the progressive party
or at least well affected toward it. This same summer the
king founded the American Farm some ten miles east of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>Seoul and stocked it with foreign seeds and cattle, with the
idea of providing Korean farmers with a sort of object-lesson
in farming, and to provide seeds for distribution among the
people. The United States Department of Agriculture sent
a large stock of seeds by the hand of the special embassy of
which Min Yŭng-ik formed the head.</p>

<p class='c000'>Late in the autumn the German representative arrived
and concluded a treaty on behalf of his government. A
month later a treaty was ratified with Great Britain and a
Consulate General was founded in Seoul.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the opening of 1884 the state of affairs in the peninsula
was something as follows. The progressive and conservative
elements in the government were clearly differentiated.
The innovations effected by the progressives had
raised in them the hope of being able to speedily reorganize
the government on a foreign basis, and the degree of their
success marked the increasing suspicion and <a id='corr233.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='oppositon'>opposition</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_233.17'>opposition</a></span> of the
conservative element. The latter were strengthened in
their position by the presence and active support of the
Chinese generals and troops, and the influence of the foreign
adviser von Mollendorf was always on the side of Chinese interests.
The ex-Regent was for the time being out of the
war and a great stumbling-block to the Min faction was thus
removed. The king and queen were both favorably inclined
toward a progressive policy but the latter was gradually being
drawn back into line with the conservative element of
which the Min family was the leading representative. Min
Yŭng-ik was still true to his better instincts and was an
ardent supporter of the progressionist views but his return
from America was the sign for a vigorous attack upon his enlightened
views by the members of his family and he was being
rapidly alienated from the party whose interests he had
tentatively espoused. It was not, however, till later in the
year that he broke away entirely from the progressive following.</p>

<p class='c000'>The spring of 1884 saw the arrival of Ensign Geo. C.
Foulk as naval attache of the American Legation. He rapidly
became acquainted with the leading officials and it was
through his advice and aid that several reformatory measures
were promulgated. In the sixth moon the influence of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>progressive party secured the position of Mayor of Seoul for
Pak Yŭng-hyo, one of the most ardent of the reform party,
and he immediately set to work at sanitary reforms and
municipal improvements. He began by tearing down houses
that had encroached upon the main road between the East and
the West Gates. He had not proceeded far in this good work
before he was blocked by the influence of the opposing faction.
His next move was in the direction of dress reform and he
<a id='corr234.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='succeed'>succeeded</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_234.9'>succeeded</a></span> in putting through a law prohibiting the use of the
long sleeves, long hat-strings and long girdle strings. In
these efforts he was seconded to a certain extent by Min
Yŭng-ik, but at this point terminates the latter’s active interest
in reforms, and from about this time the progressive
leaders began to look upon him as a traitor to their cause.
Here again personal interest came to injure a cause which,
while good in itself, was discredited by the means used to effect
its end. One sign of advance was the establishment of a
school for the training of interpreters in English, under the
charge of a competent foreign instructor.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the autumn of this year 1884 twelve of the young
men who had been sent to Japan to study military tactics returned
to Seoul, among them being Sŭ Chă p’il, known in later
years as Dr. Philip Jaisohn, who though still a youth of about
twenty years began to take an active part in the plans of the
liberal or progressive party. By this time Min Yŭng-ik had
practically taken his stand with the conservatives, and this
tended in no small measure to draw away from the progressives
the sympathy and support of the queen. It was becoming
evident that the hopes of the liberals were to be dashed
to the ground. Yuan, the Chinese commissioner, was staying
at the barracks in front of the palace and was active in the
interests of his own government, which meant that he urged
on the conservative party in their <a id='corr234.33'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='oppostion'>opposition</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_234.33'>opposition</a></span> to reforms. It
can hardly be wondered at then that the progressives looked
more and more to the Japanese from whom they had imbibed
their ideas of progress. Japan had recognized the independence
of Korea and this naturally carried with it a desire to see Korea
progress along the same lines that had raised Japan out of the
rut of centuries to the more satisfactory plane of enlightened
government.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>How to stem the tide that had set so strongly against
them was a difficult problem for the progressionist leaders to
solve. From time immemorial the method of effecting changes
in the Korea government had been to make an uprising,
secure the person of the king and banish or <a id='corr235.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='excute'>execute</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_235.5'>execute</a></span> the leaders
of the opposition. It must be remembered that at that
time, so far as the mass of the people was concerned, the progressive
party had little or no backing. On the other hand
the conservatives had the ear of the king and were backed by
a Chinese army. It was evidently necessary to secure military
backing, and for this Japan alone was available. But it
was manifestly impossible for Japan to come in and attempt
to effect the change. It must be at the request of the Korean
government, or at least of the king. It seemed that the only
thing to do was to hasten a crisis, obtain possession of the
person of the king and then see to it that Japan be invited to
loan troops to preserve the new status.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instead of waiting patiently and suffering temporary defeat
with the hope of ultimate success, the progressive leaders
determined to have recourse to the old method, and in so doing
they made a fatal blunder. Even had they been successful
the means they employed would have fatally discredited
them in the eyes of all enlightened people.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is generally accepted as true that the progressive leaders
had a distinct understanding with the Japanese. A Japanese
man-of-war was on the way to Chemulpo and was expected
to arrive on the fifth or sixth of December and the
uprising was set for the seventh of that month. The leaders
in this movement had not been able to keep it entirely a secret,
for some of them talked about it in a very excited manner
<a id='corr235.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>of</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_235.31'>of</a></span> the Naval Attache of the American Legation and it
came to the ears of the British Consul-general, who, meeting
Yun T’ă-jun on December fourth, asked him if he had heard
that there was trouble in the air. That gentleman who was
himself a strong <a id='corr235.35'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='convervative'>conservative</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_235.35'>conservative</a></span> and a close friend of Min T’ă-ho,
hastened to the house of the latter and reported what he
had heard. Min advised him to hasten to the house of one of
the relatives of one of the <a id='corr235.38'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='pregressionists'>progressionists</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_235.38'>progressionists</a></span> and secure information
if possible. He did so, and there happened to meet one
of the leaders of the progressive party and intimated to him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>that he had heard that trouble was brewing. This man denied
all knowledge of any such plan but the minute his caller had
gone he hastened to the other progressionist leaders and told
them that all was lost unless instant action were taken. News
had just arrived that the Japanese gun-boat that was expected
at Chemulpo had broken down and could not come. There
were only a few hundred Japanese troops in Seoul at the
time. But it seemed to these men that it would be better to
risk the whole venture on a single cast than to wait passively
and see the destruction of all their hopes and plans. The
seventh of December was the appointed day but as this was a
matter of kill or be killed it was decided to proceed at once to
business. Hong Yŭng-sik had been made Post-master General
and on this very night he was to give a banquet at the
new post-office which was situated in that part of the city
called Kyo-dong. It was decided to start the ball rolling at
this point. The evening came and the guests assembled to
the dinner. They were the Chinese leaders Yuan, Chin and
Wang, United States Minister Foote and his secretary Mr.
Scudder, the British Consul-general Aston, the Foreign Office
Adviser von Mollendorf, the Koreans Hong Yŭng-sik,
Kim Ok-kyun, Min Yŭng-ik, Pak Yŭng-ho, Sŭ Kwang-bom,
Kim Hŭng-jip, Han Kyu-jik, Pak Chöng-yang, O Yun-jung
and a few others. The Japanese Minister had excused himself
on the plea of ill-health. It was noticed that Kim Ok-kyun
rose and left the table several times and went out into
the court-yard but no special significance was attached to
this. The dinner began at an early hour, not far from six
o’clock, and about seven o’clock an alarm of fire was sounded.
A house immediately in front of the Post Office was in
flames. Min Yŭng-ik, being one of the officials whose duty it
was to superintend the extinguishing of conflagrations, rose
from the table and hastened out, calling to his servants to
follow. As he passed out of the inner gate, a man dressed in
Japanese clothes leaped out of the shadow of the gate-way and
struck at him savagely with a sword, wounding him severely
in the head and in other parts of the body. He fell heavily
to the ground and in the confusion that ensued the would-be
assassin made good his escape. Von Mollendorf was not far
behind, and seeing what had happened he hastened forward,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>lifted the wounded man in his arms and carried him back
into the dining-room. The Koreans who were present fled
precipitately making their exit not by the door but by way of
the back wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wounded man was conveyed to the residence of von
Mollendorf which was in the vicinity, where Dr. H. N. Allen
of the American Presbyterian Mission was soon in attendance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The die had now been cast and there was no retreat.
The leaders of the conspiracy, Kim Ok-kyun, Sŭ Kwang-bom,
Pak Yŭng-hyo, Hong Yŭng-sik and Sŭ Chă-pil, hastened immediately
to the palace known to us as “The Old Palace”
where the king had resided since the insurrection of 1882.
Entering the royal presence they announced that the Chinese
were coming to take possession of the king’s person and that
he must hasten to a place of safety. The king did not believe
this report but as they insisted he had no recourse but to submit.
The little company hastened along under the west wall
of the palace until they came to a small gate leading into
Kyöng-u Palace which adjoins the “Old Palace” on the west.
As they proceeded Kim Ok-kyun asked the king to send to
the Japanese Minister asking for a body-guard, but he refused.
Thereupon Sŭ Kwang-bom drew out a piece of foreign note-paper
and a pencil and wrote in Chinese the words “Let
the Japanese Minister come and give me his help.” This
was immediately despatched by a servant. That it was a
mere matter of form was evident when the little company
passed into the Kyöng-u Palace, for there they found the Japanese
Minister and his interpreter already in attendance and
with them some two hundred troops drawn up in line. When
the king appeared they saluted. There were present also the
twelve students who had been in Japan. Word was immediately
sent to Sin Keui-sŭn, Pak Yŭng-hyo and O Yun-jung to come
and receive office under the reconstructed government. Within
half an hour they were in attendance, excepting O Yun-jung
who happened to be away in the country at the time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very early in the morning a royal messenger was sent
with the <em>myong-p‘a</em> or “summoning tablet” to the houses of
Min T‘ă-ho, Min Yŭng-mok and Cho Ryŭng-ha, ordering
them to appear at once before the king. They complied and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>hastened to the palace but no sooner had they entered the
palace gate than they were seized and cut down in cold
blood. Then the <a id='corr238.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='summos'>summons</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_238.3'>summons</a></span> was sent to Han Kyu-jik, Yi Cho-yun
and Yun T‘ă jŭn. They too were assassinated as soon as
they entered the palace. A eunuch named Yu Cha-hyŭn was
also put to death. It is useless to ask by whose hand these
men fell. <a id='corr238.7'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Whowever'>Whoever</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_238.7'>Whoever</a></span> wielded the brutal sword, the leaders of
the so-called progressive party were wholly responsible. The
twelve young men who had returned from Japan were all fully
armed and it is more than probable that they took an active
part in the bloody work. Not only was not the king consulted
in regard to these murders but in the case of the eunuch it
was done in spite of his entreaties and remonstrances.</p>

<p class='c000'>These seven men who thus went to their doom were not
entirely unconscious of what awaited them. When Cho Ryŭng-ha
received the summons the inmates of his house pleaded
with him not to go, but as it was the king’s summons he
would not disobey even though he knew it meant death.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just at daylight the king was removed to the house of
his cousin Yi Chă-wŭn, escorted by the Japanese soldiers who
surrounded him four deep. Kim Ok-kyun gave passes to
those who were to be allowed to go in and out and only such
had access to the premises. After remaining there some three
hours the whole company returned to the “Old Palace.” In
the reconstructed government Yi Chă wŭn and Hong Yŭng-sik
were made Prime Ministers, Pak Yŭng-hyo was made
General-in chief. Su Kwang-bom was made Minister of Foreign
Affairs, Kim Ok-kyun Minister of Finance and Sŭ Chă-p‘il
Lieutenant-general. The rest of the young men who had
studied in Japan were also given official position.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before Yun T‘ă-jŭn, Yi Cho-yŭn and Han Kyu-jik went
to the palace and met their fate they sent word to Yuan warning
him of the state of affairs and asking help, but he made no
immediate move. As the morning broke thousands of Koreans
came to him and said that the Japanese held the king a
prisoner in the palace and begged him to interfere. Yuan replied
by sending a messenger to the Japanese Minister demanding
why he had surrounded the king with soldiers and had
killed the ministers, and demanding that he immediately
evacuate the place. Three hours passed and still no answer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>came; and at last Yuan and the two other Chinese leaders
took a strong body of Chinese troops and several hundred
Korean troops and proceeded to the palace. Entering by way
of the Sun-in Gate and passing through the Ch‘ang-kyŭng
Palace they approached the Po-t‘ong Gate which gave entrance
to the “Old Palace,” but they found it strongly guarded
by Japanese. Here a sharp encounter took place which lasted
an hour, beginning about three o’clock in the afternoon.
About ten each of the Chinese, Japanese and Koreans fell in
this assault. As the darkness came on the Japanese began to
fall back and taking the king and the newly appointed ministers
they made their way to the extreme northeasterly portion
of the palace grounds, not far from the Hong-wha Gate. The
royal party took refuge in a summer house there and the Japanese
stationed themselves behind trees and guarded the
place, keeping up a lively fusillade with the Chinese who had
followed them. Meanwhile the Crown Prince, the Queen and
the king’s foster-mother had escaped in small closed chairs
out the Sŭn-in Gate and had found refuge in the house of Yi
Pom-jin in the village of No-wŭn, twenty li outside the East
Gate.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chances of success for the Japanese were becoming
smaller and smaller and the king was anxiously looking for
an opportunity of escaping from them and making his way to
the Chinese side. At last, taking advantage of the extreme
disorder that prevailed, he made his way to the Puk-chang
Gate at the extreme northeastern part of the palace enclosure.
Outside there was a crowd of Korean soldiers who wished to
gain entrance and rescue the king from his captors. When
the latter made his presence known inside the gate these
soldiers effected an entrance and lifting His Majesty on their
shoulders carried him in triumph to the North Temple just
inside the Northeast Gate. Seeing that all hope of immediate
success was gone, Pak <a id='corr239.35a'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>Yŭng-hyo</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_239.35a'>Yŭng-hyo</a></span>, Kim Ok-kyun, Sŭ <a id='corr239.35b'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Kwang-bom'>Kwang-bom,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_239.35b'>Kwang-bom,</a></span>
Sŭ Chă-p‘il and a part of the company of military students
accompanied the Japanese troops out the front gate of the
palace to the Japanese Legation which was then situated in
Kyo-dong. This was accomplished in the midst of great excitement.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile Hong Yŭng-sik, Pak <a id='corr239.40'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>Yŭng-kyo</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_239.40'>Yŭng-kyo</a></span>, Sin Keui-sŭn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>and seven of the military students had followed the fortunes of
the king. But no sooner did the party arrive at the North
Temple than the people fell upon Hong Yŭng-sik and Pak
<a id='corr240.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>Yŭng-kyo</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_240.4'>Yŭng-kyo</a></span> and hacked them to pieces before the king’s eyes.
Hong Yŭng-sik attempted to hide in a closet behind His
Majesty but the latter indicated by a nod of the head that he
was concealed there and the people dragged him out and dispatched
him on the spot. The seven students tried to effect
their escape but were pursued and killed, one below Chong-no,
and another at Yŭn-mot-kol.</p>

<p class='c000'>No sooner had the morning dawned than the Japanese Minister
formed his little company in a hollow square, placed the
Korean refugees and the Japanese women and children in the
center, fired the legation buildings and marched out through
the city on their way to Chemulpo, shooting at any Koreans
whom they happened to see in their way. They found the
West Gate locked but they soon forced it and hurried away
to the port. All the Japanese in Seoul did not escape thus,
for there were a few living in Chin-go-gă. That same day
the Koreans mobbed them and killed them all, <a id='corr240.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='men'>men,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_240.20'>men,</a></span> women and
children.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Japanese merchant vessel happened to be lying at
Chemulpo and the Minister with all his company boarded her,
carrying the Koreans with them. The latter were hidden in
the hold.</p>

<p class='c000'>That same day, later in the afternoon, the king made his
way to the Ha-do-gam where the Chinese had camped, and
put himself under their protection. Cho Pyŭng-ho was sent
to Chemulpo to ask the Japanese Minister not to leave, and to
effect the arrest of the fugitives. In neither quest was he
successful.</p>

<p class='c000'>An anxious month passed by and at last the Japanese,
Count Inouye, came with a guard of 600 troops and took up
his quarters at the governor’s place outside the West Gate.
Negotiations were at once begun and as a result the Korean
Government agreed to pay an indemnity of 600,000 yen. Sŭ
Sang-u and P. G. von Mollendorf were sent as commissioners
to Japan to arrange suitable terms for the renewal of friendly
relations. To make good their protestations of regret at
the killing of defenseless Japanese in Seoul four men who took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>part in that work were arrested and put to death. At the same
time Yi Ch‘ang-gyu, Sŭ Chă-Ch‘ang, Kim Pong-jung and five
others who had been charged with complicacy in the plot were
seized and executed.</p>

<p class='c000'>On January ninth 1885 Kim Hong-Jip, Special Korean
Commissioner, signed with Count Inouye a convention regarding
the trouble of the <a id='corr241.7'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>preceeding</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_241.7'>preceeding</a></span> month, by the terms of
which the government agreed to apologize to the Japanese
emperor, to pay an indemnity of 110,000 yen, to execute the
murderer of Lieut. Isobayachi, to give a site for a new Legation
and 20,000 yen for its construction and to set aside a site
for barracks for the Japanese guard. Early in the Spring the
Japanese Legation was built, being the first foreign building
in Seoul.</p>

<p class='c000'>The year 1885 beheld many events of importance. The
government hospital was founded under royal patronage by
Dr. H. N. Allen of the American Presbyterian Mission. It
beheld also the arrival of that great vanguard of civilization
the Protestant Missionary. Dr. Allen had arrived in the
previous year but now the Presbyterian and Methodist
Churches of America sent a number of representatives into
Seoul to secure property and begin preparations for the founding
of regular evangelistic and educational work. In April
the Chinese and Japanese signed the celebrated Tientsin Convention
by the terms of which they both agreed to evacuate
Korea and not to send troops there without previously notifying
each other. It was the breaking of this convention by
China which was one of the immediate causes of the Japan-China
war. At this same time, England, fearing the occupation
of Port Hamilton by Russia, sent a fleet of war vessels
and occupied the place herself. She was finally induced to
leave, but only after China had guaranteed to secure it against
occupation by any other power. In October the treaty with
Russia was signed and a Legation was established in Seoul.
The ex-Regent was still in China, but the Chinese government
now deemed it safe to send him back to the peninsula,
and Min Chŭng-muk was sent to act as his escort.</p>

<p class='c000'>Since the day when the Regent threw the finances of the
country into confusion by the debasement of the currency and
since the officials had learned how much the people would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>endure of unjust taxation, in the days when every means was
adopted to wring from them the funds for the erection of the
palace, official indirection had been on the rapid increase.
The people were being imposed upon more and more. All the
money that dishonest men paid to corrupt officials to purchase
office had to be drawn from the people later by dishonest
means. The main qualification of a successful prefect was
the ability to judge when he had reached the limit of the
people’s endurance. The year 1885 beheld a serious revolt in
Yö-ju where the prefect had overstepped the dead-line of the
peoples’ patience. He was driven out and his <em>ajun</em> or clerk
was killed. The prefect of Wŭn-ju also escaped death only by
flight, while an <em>ajun</em> was killed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not the least important event of 1885 was the completion
under Chinese patronage of the Seoul-Peking telegraph line
by which Korea was for the first time put into quick communication
with the rest of the world. At the dictation of
China a commissioner, Yi Chung-ha was sent north to meet a
Chinese commissioner and determine the exact boundary between
Korean and Chinese territory along the Tu-man
River.</p>

<p class='c000'>A customs service had been begun by von Mollendorf on
an independent basis but in July of 1885 he was dismissed
from service in the Foreign Office and two months later he
was relieved of work in the Customs because of unwarrantable
schemes into which he had drawn that department of the
government. The whole service was thereupon put under the
management of Sir Robert Hart the Inspector General of the
Chinese Customs. An entirely new staff of men was sent from
China. H. N. Merrill was made Chief Commissioner and
Chemulpo, Fusan and Wŭnsan were put in charge of men
directly from the Chinese Customs staff. This was a guarantee
of excellent management but it proved to be the strongest
lever China had in the carrying out her ambitious plans in the
peninsula. Before the close of the year Gen. Foote without
giving specific reasons retired from the United States Legation
and returned to America, Ensign Geo. C. Foulk becoming
Charge d’Affaires.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the early months of 1886 Yi To-jă, Sin Keui-sŭn, Hong
Chin-yu, An Chŭng-su and Kyöng Kwang-guk were banished to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>distant islands for complicacy in the plot which led to the
emeute of 1884.</p>

<p class='c000'>In February the king by royal edict abolished the hereditary
transmission of slaves and the use of slave labor by the
guilds in the work on the palaces. This was a measure of
far-reaching import had it been carried out in full; but we
find that it had to be re-enacted in 1894.</p>

<p class='c000'>The government desired to secure the services of a foreign
expert as adviser to the Home and Foreign Offices and with
the sanction of Li Hung-chang, the Chinese Viceroy, Judge O.
N. Denny, ex-Consul-general of U. S. to China, was called and
he arrived in the spring of 1886 just in time to be present at
the signing of the treaty with France. He had for some years
been on rather intimate terms with the Great Viceroy and it
is probable that the latter hoped to use the Judge in forwarding
Chinese interests in Korea. If so he found himself
grievously mistaken for the United States as well as Japan
and France, had recognized the independence of Korea, and
Judge Denny devoted his energies to the maintenance of that
independence. Yuan the Chinese <a id='corr243.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='commissior'>commissioner</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_243.20'>commissioner</a></span> had taken up
his residence in Seoul and had dubbed himself “Resident” in
opposition to the Korean claim to independence. The Peking
government, forgetting or ignoring the fact that whenever
Korea had gotten into trouble she (China) had always disavowed
responsibility and had practically disclaimed suzerainty,
now began to bolster up her claims and to use every
means to make good her pretensions. The dominant party
which had ridden into power on the shoulders of the Chinese
put no obstacles in the way and thus Judge Denny found himself
blocked in his efforts to better the condition of the
country.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was generally understood that the right of Japanese
and Western foreigners to reside in Seoul was based on the
most favored nation clause in the treaties and that if the Chinese
removed from Seoul the others could be compelled to do
likewise. The Chinese, therefore, hoping, it is said, to secure
more exclusive power in the capital by the removal of other
foreigners began to agitate the question of removing all their
nationals to Yong-san near the river three miles from Seoul.
For a time it appeared as if this might be done but the large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>vested rights of the Japanese in the capital as well as the interests
of others caused a counter agitation which frustrated
the scheme.</p>

<p class='c000'>Geo. C. Foulk, Ensign in the U. S. Navy, had long been
in connection with the Legation in Seoul. Early in 1881 he
had suggested to the government the advisability of founding
a school for the instruction of young Koreans in Western languages
and sciences, and consequently the United States
Secretary of State was requested by the Korean government
to secure three men as instructors; but the emeute of that
year had deferred the matter. In 1886 it was again brought
up and in July three men who had been selected by the U. S.
Commissioner of Education arrived at the Korean Capital. A
terrible epidemic of cholera devastated the city that summer
and as many as seven or eight hundred deaths occurred daily.
It was in September that the Royal English School was opened.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chinese claims to suzerainty emboldened the Chinese
merchants to attempt to evade the customs regulations and
the result was a serious affray in Chemulpo when the Chinese
tried to evade the export on ginseng. The Chinese Commissioner
tried to uphold them in it but a vigorous protest to Li
Hung-chang righted the matter and the offenders were deported
and the Customs Service was vindicated.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was in this year that the trading station Whe-ryŭng on
the Tu-man River was established for convenience of trade
with Russia but it was not made an open port. About this
time the school founded by the American Methodist Mission
received royal recognition and the king conferred upon it
the name Pai Chai Hak Tang or “Hall for the Rearing of
Useful Men.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Contrary to the wishes of the Chinese a Korean Minister
to America was appointed in the person of Pak Chöng-yang,
but in attempting to start for America he was intercepted by
the Chinese just outside the South Gate and compelled to return.
Two months later, however, he succeeded in getting
away. He was received in Washington with all the punctiliousness
due to a Minister from any sovereign power. This
helped in a certain way to forward Korea’s claim to independence
but America’s well-known policy of non-interferance in
foreign matters largely neutralized its effect.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>The year 1888 beheld what is known as the “Baby War.”
The report was spread abroad that the Europeans and Americans
were stealing children and boiling them in kettles for
food. It was also generally believed that the foreigners
caught women and cut off their breasts in order to extract
from them the condensed milk which was so commonly used
among the foreign residents. The Koreans knew that the
foreigners had no cows and they could explain the use of
milk only on the above theory. The <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span></em> was said
to be as follows. The foreigners were possessed of a peculiar
drug which became a powerful gas when introduced into the
mouth. Approaching a Korean paper covered lattice door at
the dead of night the operator would make a tiny hole in the
paper and applying his mouth to it would blow the gas into
the room. The effect would be that if there were a woman in
the room she would waken and be seized with an <a id='corr245.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>uncontrolable</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_245.16'>uncontrolable</a></span>
desire to go outside. Once without the door, the foreigner
would seize her, cut off her breasts and return to his
home. It was believed that they had paid agents among the
people to whom they taught the secret and whom they sent
about the country to secure women’s breasts. Two suspicious
looking men were set upon in Hong-ch‘ŭn charged with
being breast-hunters. They narrowly escaped with their
lives. For a short time there was imminent danger of an
uprising but a royal proclamation couched in trenchant language
did much to calm the excitement and the danger subsided
as suddenly as it had arisen. In Eui-ju there was a
most destructive flood in which 300 lives were lost and 1927
houses were swept away.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this time the administration of the government was
anything but exemplary. The selling of the same office at
such short intervals increased the burden on the people to an
almost unbearable point, so that there were frequent uprisings
in country districts. In Korea the people form the court of
final appeal. If a prefect oversteps the line which marks the
limit of the people’s endurance and they drive him from the
place the government ordinarily accepts it as final.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following year the government was obliged to take
notice of this state of things and the king sent out a proclamation
saying that the taking of bribes and the extortion of
money in the provinces would be severely punished. He took
this opportunity also to speak about robbery and gambling,
which had begun to run rife in the land. The people were
forbidden to dress in silk, excepting those over fifty years of
age.</p>

<p class='c000'>The year 1890 opened with serious trouble in Ham-gyŭng
Province. Cho Pyŭng-sik, a man of indomitable will and one
whose unbridled temper had more than once gotten him into
serious trouble, was governor in that province. The people
had mortgaged their bean crop to the Japanese exporters, of
Wŭn-san, and had received some $176,000 therefor. But when
the beans had been harvested and were ready for shipment
the governor forbade its delivery. He wanted the Japanese to
sell it back to the people, as it was a year of scarcity, but this
they refused to do; and the beans rotted where they lay. The
Japanese promptly took the matter up and demanded an indemnity.
The Foreign Office at once recognised the validity
of the claim but the king ordered Cho Pyŭng-sik to pay the
bill himself, since he had acted throughout without orders
from Seoul. The unhappy governor was obliged to part with
all his patrimony and several of his relatives had to do likewise.
As this was not enough to settle the bill the government
paid the balance.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>This year saw the first embassy to Europe appointed in
the person of Cho Siu-heui but owing to his illness his place
was filled by Pak Che-sun who started on his mission but
never got further than Hong-kong. It is probable that it was
through Chinese influence that he got no further. The fourth
moon of the year saw the death of the aged Dowager Queen
Cho, through whose influence the present king came to the
throne. She was buried with royal honors and the people assumed
mourning for one year.</p>

<p class='c000'>Serious difficulties arose in regard to the fisheries in the
south. The Japanese had been accorded the right to fish in
Korean waters, but on the island of Quelpart a curious custom
prevails. The women do the fishing. They enter the
water entirely nude and gather shell-fish. All males are prohibited
by law from coming within sight of the fishing-grounds.
The Japanese fishing-boats, however, did not hesitate
to pass into these prohibited waters and as a result the
Koreans were deprived of the means of livelihood. The Korean
government took the reasonable ground that the Japanese
in coming near the Korean coast should observe the local
customs and prejudices, but the Japanese government refused
to take any sentimental view of the question and after a long
discussion the Koreans failed to carry their point.</p>

<p class='c000'>The year 1891 beheld the elevation to power of Min
Yong-jun a man who championed the most conservative principles
of the retrogressive party in power. The king’s son
by the concubine Lady Kang was made Prince Eui-wha. Corruption
in official circles was accentuated by the lessening of
the term of office of country prefects thereby entailing fresh
burdens on the people, for they had to provide each prefect
with money to liquidate the debt he had incurred in purchasing
the position. There was an instant and loud outcry from
all sides. The powers that be saw that the limit of the <a id='corr247.33'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='peoples'>people’s</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_247.33'>people’s</a></span>
endurance had been passed and they hastened to revoke
the law. This same year a consulate was founded at Tientsin
and Yi Myŭng-sang became the first incumbent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another sign of retrogression was the execution of six
men charged with being accessory to the insurrection of 1882
although eleven years had passed since that event.</p>

<p class='c000'>The year 1892 passed without witnessing many events of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>special importance, excepting that the state of things kept
getting worse and worse. It was a time during which the
country was ripening for the great disturbances of the following
year. History shows that when the Korean people are
treated with anything like a fair degree of justice they are
loyal and peaceful. So long as the Korean is called upon to
pay not more than three or four times the legal rate of tax he
will endure it quietly and there will be no talk of seditious
sects arising; but the people are well aware that they themselves
form the court of final appeal and when all other means
fail they are not slow to adopt any means of righting their
wrongs.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1893 Korea began to reap what she had sown in 1891
and 1892. Having sown the wind she began to reap the
whirlwind. The whole province of P‘yŭng-an was in a ferment.
Insurrections occurred in Kang-gye, Song-ch‘ŭn,
Ham-jong and in other parts of the province. But the difficulty
was not confined to the North. The sect called the
Tong-hak which had arisen in 1864 began to show its head in
the south again. Rumors began to multiply in Seoul that
they were coming to the capital in great numbers to drive out
the Japanese and other foreigners. The government despatched
O Yun-jung, a civilian, to pacify them and for a time quiet
was preserved, but in March threatening plackards were fastened
to foreigners’ gates in Seoul inveighing against the
Christian religion and warning foreigners to leave the country
at once. It was the general feeling that although serious
trouble was not likely to occur in Seoul it would be well to be
in a state of preparedness in case the Tong-hak saw fit to put
their words to the test of action.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this time the Queen was extremely well-disposed toward
that class of female spiritual mediums called <em>mudang</em>,
and one of them was elevated to the rank of Princess. A Korean,
An Hyo-je, who memorialised the king against such
practices, was overwhelmed with obloquy and was banished
to the island of Quelpart. Min Yong-jun had taken advantage
of his high position to add private profit to public usefulness
and loud complaints were heard on all sides against him
and against others of the same name. Insurrections of greater
or less degree occurred in different parts of the country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>and it seemed as if Korea were on the verge of anarchy. It
can hardly be gainsaid that this state of affairs was the legitimate
outcome of pro-Chinese agitation and was directly in line
with immemorial custom in China. Nothing could be truer
than that Korea needed reforming. The government found
it necessary to deal with great severity in some cases. Four
prefects were taken to the center of the city and publicly
beaten and then banished. Even Min Yong-jun had to go
through the form of punishment in this public way, for the
people of the capital were so incensed against him that an insurrection
seemed imminent unless they were appeased. The
Songdo people revolted against the extortion that was practiced
against them but they were overcome and their ginseng
was taken away from them by Kim Se-geui, the right hand
man of Min Yong-jun.</p>

<p class='c000'>Late in the year the Tong-hak made a startling proclamation
which they secretly nailed to the gate of the governor’s
yamen in Chŭn-ju. It called upon all right-minded men to
join in the march on the capital and the extirpation of the
foreigners. This seemed more tangible than the former
rumors and foreign men-of-war began to congregate at Chemulpo
for the protection of their nationals in Seoul. Hundreds
of Japanese left the city and hurried to Chemulpo for safety.
A force of Korean infantry marched southward to head off the
revolutionists but they were easily defeated and their arms and
accoutrements fell into the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was quite evident that the Korean government was
without the means or the men to cope with such determined
opposition. This deplorable state of things was looked upon
by Japan with some uneasiness. Korea seemed to be coming
more and more under Chinese influence and in the same proportion
her internal management became more corrupt. Japan
regarded Korea as an independent power and was determined
to see that independence upheld. This feeling on the part of
Japan was sharply accentuated when in the spring of 1894 a
Korean detective, Hong Chong-u, succeeded in gaining the confidence
of Kim Ok-kyun who was living at Tokyo as a political
refugee. He was induced to accompany his betrayer to
Shanghai where, in a hotel, his betrayer shot him down in
cold blood. The Chinese government condoned the dastardly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>deed and sent the assassin, together with the body of his
victim, to Korea in a Chinese gunboat. The body of Kim Ok-kyun
was dismembered on April fourteenth in a most brutal
manner and the different portions of his body were sent about
the country as a warning to traitors. This lapse into the
worst excesses of the old regime opened the eyes of Japan to
the actual situation and gave her just the impetus she needed
to take the strong position which she did later. Soon after
this the Tong-hak took the town of Chŭn-ju and defeated all
the government troops sent against them. The governor of
the province, Kim Mun-hyŭn, made his escape from the place.</p>

<p class='c000'>The government had at last become convinced of its inability
to cope with its enemies single-handed and it determined
to have recourse to the dangerous policy of asking China to
throw troops into the peninsula to aid in putting down the
Tong-hak uprising. China immediately complied and on June
sixth 1,500 Chinese troops were embarked at Tientsin and
were sent to Chemulpo under the escort of three gunboats.</p>

<p class='c000'>It must be remembered that according to the third article
of the Tientsin Convention China and Japan each agreed not
to send troops into Korea without first notifying the other. In
this case the Chinese failed to notify the Japanese until after
the departure of the troops and there can be no doubt that at
this point lies the strength of Japan’s contention. When,
later, the Chinese agreed to leave Korea simultaneously with
the Japanese the latter naturally refused. The Chinese broke
the convention first; they must leave first. But there were
other important points involved. Korea was rapidly losing
all semblance of independence and Japan was being jeopardized.
The Chinese abrogation of the treaty gave Japan just the
excuse she wanted for throwing troops into Korea and compelling
those reforms which she believed could be effected in
no other way. No sooner was she informed of China’s action
than the Japanese Minister Otori, then on leave of absence,
was recalled, and sent immediately to Seoul with 400 marines,
arriving June ninth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chinese force did not approach the capital but landed
at Asan some eighty miles south of Seoul. This force
was soon augmented till it amounted to 2,000 men. But
Japan was not idle. By the twelfth of June she had approximately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>8,000 troops in Korea. Matters stood thus when the
news came that the Tong-hak, either frightened by the rumor
of the approach of a Chinese army or being pressed by the
government troops, had suddenly retired and the south was
at peace. This tended to hasten a crisis between the Chinese
and Japanese. There was no longer any cause why foreign
troops should remain in the peninsula. The Chinese had
come to put down the Tong-hak and the Japanese had come
ostensibly to protect their nationals. Now that the Tong-haks
had retired it did not take long to discover the real
reasons underlying the actions of the Japanese. On June 16th
she landed 3,000 more troops at Chemulpo and matters began
to look so serious in Seoul that all the Chinese residents hastened
away from the city and sought safety by embarking for
China. About a thousand people thus made a hasty exit
from the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>On June 25th the Russian, British, French and American
representatives in Seoul, in the interests of peace, jointly
requested the Chinese and Japanese to simultaneously withdraw.
But the Chinese refused to go until the Japanese did
and the Japanese refused to go until reforms had been introduced
which would clear the political atmosphere and give
some semblance of truth to the fiction of Korean independence.
The Korean government was thrown into consternation
when on June 28th the Japanese Minister demanded a
formal statement from Korea as to whether she were an independent
state or not. She replied that she was an independent
power.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in July the Japanese Minister handed the government
a list of the reforms which it deemed necessary. As
they were all incorporated in the reforms inaugurated a little
later it is unnecessary to enumerate them here. Fifteen
thousand Japanese troops had by this time landed on Korean
soil and the capital was thoroughly invested. The prospects
of peace seemed to be growing smaller each day. The people
of Seoul fled in large numbers leaving their houses and all
their effects except such as could be carried on their backs.
Such was the terror that the very name of the Japanese inspired.</p>

<p class='c000'>On July 20th the Japanese Minister sent an ultimatum to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>the king complaining of the introduction of Chinese troops
whose coming was undeniably to protect a dependent state. He
gave the king three days to accept Japanese reforms. If within
that time he did not accede to them they would be enforced.
On the night of the 22nd the king returned an evasive answer
and this decided the immediate policy of the Japanese.
On the following morning two battalions of Japanese troops,
feigning to start out for Asan, turned suddenly and marched
on the palace. They met with a certain weak show of resistance
at the gates but easily forced their way in and soon had
the king in their care. Every member of the Min faction was
forthwith driven out and the Prince Tai-wŭn was called in to
assume a leading part in the management of the government.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time China and Japan were hurrying troops into
the peninsula, the former by way of Asan <a id='corr252.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='aad'>and</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_252.15'>and</a></span> the latter by
Fusan and Chemulpo. On July 21st eleven steamers left
Taku for Asan and the mouth of the Yalu with 8,000 troops.
Those that came to Asan were ostensibly for the purpose of
aiding the government in the putting down of the Tong-hak.
The Japanese government was immediately apprised of the
departure of the transports from the Peiho and on July 25th
the Akitsushima, Yoshino and Naniwa, among the best of the
Japanese navy, were ordered from Sasebo to Asan. Two days
later at six-thirty they encountered the Chinese men-of-war
Tsi-yuen and Kwang-ki in the vicinity of P’ung Island off Asan.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Japanese were not aware of the sudden turn which
affairs had taken in Seoul but the Chinese were, and they
expected the Japanese to take the offensive. The Japanese
became aware of the situation only when they found the
Chinese did not salute and that they were cleared for action.
The Japanese speedily put themselves in fighting trim. As
the channel narrowed and the vessels came within range the
Chinese opened fire and were answered with terrible effect by
the Japanese. The <a id='corr252.35'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Kwang-yi'>Kwang-ki</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_252.35'>Kwang-ki</a></span> was speedily disabled and
beached. The Tsi-yuen, her bow-gun being disabled, withdrew
toward Wei-hai-wei. It is disputed as to which side
began firing first but it is quite immaterial. The fact that the
Chinese knew what had occurred at Seoul, that they were
cleared for action and that they failed to salute would seem to
throw the burden of proof upon them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>While the Yoshino was pursuing the Tsi yuen, two more
ships appeared on the horizon. They proved to be the Chinese
dispatch boat Tsao-kiang and the British steamer Kowshing
carrying about 1,500 Chinese troops. The Akitsushima
took the former in charge and the Naniwa took the latter.
The Naniwa signalled the transport to follow her, but the
Chinese on board of her would not let the English Captain
obey. Two parleys were held but the Chinese officers were
obdurate and would not listen to reason. When it became
apparent that the Chinese were bent upon self-destruction the
Naniwa turned her battery upon her and blew her up. More
than a thousand of the Chinese troops were drowned. A large
number were picked up and held as prisoners of war. The
sinking of the Kowshing has been judged as hasty but the
situation was a peculiar one. The Chinese would neither
surrender nor follow. They were plentifully supplied with
small arms and could keep a boarding party at bay effectually.
The better judgment of second thought proves that the Japanese
were fully justified in their action.</p>

<p class='c000'>The results of the P’ung incident became apparent at
once. It made neutrals more careful, it proved that the sea
was dangerous ground for the Chinese, it kept over a thousand
men from landing at Asan and it proved beyond the
shadow of a doubt that Japan was fully in earnest and would
fight to the bitter end. Moreover it changed the whole plan
of campaign for China. The Tong-hak were forgotten and
the co-operation of the force at the Yalu and that at Asan and
a joint attack upon the Japanese was the plan determined
upon by the Chinese.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Japanese forces in and about Seoul were now ready
for a land campaign. It was wisely determined to eliminate
from the problem all the Chinese forces south of Seoul before
advancing against those in the north along the Ta-dong River.
The army in the north was being watched by mounted spies.
For the time being there was no danger to be apprehended
from these troops in the north but the two thousand at Asan,
if reinforced, might advance on the capital and make trouble
unless they were dispersed once and for all. Accordingly on
the twenty-fifth of July Gen. Oshima started for Asan with
the greater part of the troops in Seoul. The march was rapid.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>On the way the news of the P’ung incident was received and
applauded. The vicinity of Asan was reached in three days.
As the Japanese approached, the Chinese retreated a short
distance to a point which they could easily fortify. On the
twenty-eighth the Japanese army arrived within five miles of
this position. A night attack was determined upon by Gen.
Oshima. It was not explained to the army until midnight
when it was aroused and informed of the intended movement.
The advance was made in two divisions. The right wing,
four companies of infantry and one of engineers under Lieutenant-colonel
Tadeka, sought the enemy’s left. The left
wing under Gen. Oshima, and comprising nine companies of
infantry, one battalion of artillery and one company of cavalry,
swept forward in the dark to attack the flank and rear of the
enemy’s right.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would have been a difficult undertaking even by daylight
but in the dark it was fourfold more trying. The
Chinese outposts in the neighboring village gave the signal,
and, posted among the houses, offered a stubborn resistance.
The assaulting column was repulsed and was compelled to lie
down to hold the ground already taken. At last however the
Chinese had to withdraw. They crowded slowly out into the
neighboring, rice fields.</p>

<p class='c000'>This preliminary struggle was followed by a brief breathing
space. It had lasted less than an hour but had proved a
stiff encounter. At five the Japanese attached the redoubts.
The left wing now came into action and under the smoke of
the artillery the troops stormed the forts at either extremity.
In half an hour the Chinese were dislodged and the rising
sun looked down upon its flaming image on Japanese banners
flying victoriously from the Chinese ramparts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The escape of the Chinese general, Yeh Chi-chao has
given ground for the alleged Chinese victory at A-san. It
often happened during the Japan China war that, unless the
Chinese force was almost utterly annihilated, they claimed a
victory. It <a id='corr254.36'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='it'>is</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_254.36'>is</a></span> still a puzzle to many, however, that in the
Asan skirmish as well as in the battle of the Yalu the
victorious Japanese permitted even a remnant of the enemy
to escape. Although thoroughly defeated Gen. Yeh brought
a remnant of his force around the city of Seoul and arrived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>safety at P’yŭng-yang, undoubtedly a difficult and brilliant
movement.</p>

<p class='c000'>This first battle won by Japan in a foreign land, for a period
of three centuries, illustrated two points. Not only had
the Japanese soldiers learned their lesson from instructors
but the officers proved themselves worthy of the steadfastness
of the men under them. One man out of every twelve killed
was an officer. Nor, when elated by the victory, did the Japanese
forget the ends for which they were working. They did
not undertake any further subjugation of the south, not even
attempting to exterminate the Tong-haks. It was the
Chinese in the peninsula with whom they were measuring
swords. The forces at A-san being destroyed or dispersed
and danger from that quarter was consequently removed,
and the banners of rising sun turned northward.</p>

<p class='c000'>The northern division of the Chinese army, which had
been landed on Korean soil near the mouth of the Yalu River
and had advanced southward from that point, had now held
the city of P’yŭng-yang for upwards of a month. In anticipation
of a Japanese advance they had fortified it as best they
knew how, but as is usual with Chinese they had forgotten to
guard their rear. On three occasions in this war they were
attacked in their unprotected rear and utterly routed.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the second week of August the commander of the
Japanese fleet, Admiral Ito, with twenty men-of-war took a
cruise into the mouth of the Gulf of Pechili. The feint had
its desired effect, though wholly misunderstood by the world
at large. It attracted the attention of the Chinese and transport
after transport made its way safely across from Japan to
Korea with its complement of troops.</p>

<p class='c000'>On August tenth Major Ichinohe with the vanguard
started northward from Seoul. It was the first step toward
Peking. Songdo was reached the following day. The next
few days were spent in reconnoitering the Ta-dong River, but
this part retired eventually to Song-do and there awaited reinforcements.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the nineteenth Lieutenant-general Nodzu arrived
from Japan with the reinforcements for which Gen. Oshima
had been growing impatient. The latter immediately forwarded
a detachment by another route toward P’yŭng-yang.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>This was ordered to occupy an important position known as
Sak Pass and was reinforced on September eighth by a
battalion of infantry and a company of artillery. This became
known as the Sak Division.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the twenty-third Gen. Oshima set out from Seoul for
the north with a Mixed Brigade. This was the name given to
the Japanese army which participated in all the operations in
the peninsula, so called because it was made up of various
portions of the grand army. On the twenty-fifth Oshima
joined the forces at Song-do. A few days before this Gen.
Tadzumi had landed at Chemulpo and had been put in command
of the Sak <a id='corr256.12'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Divison'>Division</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_256.12'>Division</a></span>. On the twenty-sixth another
division under Gen. Sato landed at Wun-san on the east coast
nearly opposite P’yŭng-yang, and was immediately put under
the command of Gen. Nodzu. This is best known as the
Wun-san (Gensan) Division.</p>

<p class='c000'>These three bodies of troops slowly converged upon
P’yŭng-yang by three routes, and made as if they were
about to surround the entire city. But the commanders
knew the weak point in Chinese tactics too well to begin trying
new methods.</p>

<p class='c000'>P’yŭng-yang was fortified beyond the expectations of the
Japanese and it should have held out indefinitely. The Ta-dong
River flows before its walls giving it defense on the
south. On the north stands a high eminence called Peony
Mountain. To the west there are no special natural defenses.
The plan of attack was to take advantage of the proverbial
Chinese weakness, make a feint in the front but send the
main body of troops around the city and attack in the rear.
The capture of P’yŭng-yang was very much like that of
Quebec. The plan of attack was the same in each case. The
Japanese made a feint in front of the town as Wolfe did from the
shores of Levis, and sent the real attacking party around behind
the town. The capture of Peony Mountain like the
capture of the Heights of Abraham determined the struggle.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the morning of the fifteenth the Japanese army was
in position. The Sak and Gensan divisions lay before Peony
and the other five heights to the north of the city. The Mixed
Brigade lay beyond the river along the Seoul road which
led by six fortified redoubts to the bridge of boats before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>River Gate of the town. The main body had crossed the
river at Iron Island below the city and under cover of the
cannonading of the Mixed Brigade had crept nearer and
nearer the enemy from the west—the rear.</p>

<p class='c000'>At half past four on the morning of the fifteenth a terrific
cannonading was begun. Under cover of this the Sak
Division took the fort nearest the river, on the northeast of
the city. At the same time the Gensan Division took by <a id='corr257.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='assult'>assault</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_257.8'>assault</a></span>
the fort at the other end, on the north. From its
vantage ground the Gensan Division planted its guns and
poured a destructive fire on Peony Mountain. The Chinese
commander being killed, the defenders became discouraged
and demoralized and this strategic position was carried by the
Sak Division by a single assault. The guns of the enemy, being
turned upon the city from the summit of this hill, determined
the contest. The main body trained its guns on the
fifteen redoubts which guarded the western approach and
thus cut off all hope of retreat from the city.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the Japanese were having it all their own way on
the north and west the Mixed Brigade across the river was
suffering severely. Five Chinese forts guarded this main approach
to P’yŭng-yang. The Japanese troops, though ordered
to make merely a feint, were carried away by the inspiration
of the hour and rashly attempted to capture these forts
by assault, but they were greatly outnumbered and were
compelled at last to retire having lost heavily. But the fall
of Peony Mountain settled the day, and that night the Chinese
soldiers, following in the wake of their despicable commanders
sought safety in flight toward the Yalu by such avenues as
the Japanese left open for them. It is generally believed that
the Japanese purposely left open a loophole of escape, not
caring to have so many prisoners on their hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>The feint made by Admiral Ito during the first week
in August has been mentioned. During the P’yŭng-yang
campaign the Japanese fleet had been patrolling the Yellow
Sea about the Korean <a id='corr257.36'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>archipelego</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_257.36'>archipelego</a></span>. Finally the last company
of Japanese troops were landed on Korean soil and the order
was given, “On to Peking.” Never was an invasion undertaken
with such relish since the days when, three centuries
before, the hordes of Hideyoshi had landed on the coast of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>Korea and raised this same cry. The outcome now was destined
to be far different from that of the former invasion.
Marshall Yamagata arriving in Korea on Sept. 12th with
10,000 reinforcements began the new campaign as Commander-in-chief.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the P’yŭng-yang <a id='corr258.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='egagement'>engagement</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_258.5'>engagement</a></span> the Japanese fleet
had been stationed at the mouth of the Ta-dong River, forty
miles from the scene of the battle, ready to be used in any
emergency. On the sixteenth, the campaign in Korea being
settled by the flight of the Chinese army toward the Yalu,
the main and first flying squadrons weighed anchor and departed
for the supposed scene of Chinese activity at the mouth
of the Yalu, where it was believed that Chinese troops were
being landed. Two days previous 4,000 Chinese troops had
left Taku to reinforce the new army, being gathered on the
banks of the Yalu for an invasion of Korea. The transports
which contained this detachment were protected by six
cruisers and four torpedo boats and were reinforced at Talien
Bay by the Peiyang squadron. On the sixteenth the transports
landed their burden and on the following day departed
again for Taku, attended, as on the trip over, by six cruisers
and the Peiho squadron.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the same morning the Japanese fleet crossed the path
of the returning transports. At nine <a id='corr258.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='oclock'>o’clock</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_258.23'>o’clock</a></span> the smoke of the
Chinese fleet was first discovered and about twelve the fleet
came into full view. The battle opened with the main and
flying squadrons leading in a single line across the track of
the Chinese fleet, which was advancing at half the pace set by
the enemy. This formation, the ironclads in the center and
the weakest ships on either wing, had been assumed as soon
as it appeared that the Japanese line was coming head on as
if to pierce the Chinese fleet. At a range of 5,200 meters
the battle was opened by the starboard barbette of the iron-clad
Ting-yeun. The whole fleet soon joined in the fight
but the Japanese did not answer for some minutes. As the
Yoshino came on, the course was changed and the enemy
was passed from left to right. The comparatively helpless
ships of the right flank received the severest fire. The two
old cruisers on the extreme right, which were of wood and
very inflamable, at once took fire and were thenceforth useless.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>The Yang-wei took fire at the outset and retired.
The Chao-yung was not more fortunate and sank about half
past two, the battle having begun at one <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> Japanese time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two of the twelve Chinese ships were thus disposed of
at once. Two more, the Tsi-yuen and Kwang-chia, deserted
the battle immediately on various excuses and departed for
Port Arthur.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Japanese line had passed the Chinese fleet the
flying squadron had begun to port, when the two Chinese
ships, which until then had remained in the mouth of the
Yalu, were seen making their way toward the remainder of
the fleet. Instantly the flying squadron began to starboard
and the oncoming vessels prudently retired. These two
ships, the Kwan-ping and Ping-yuen, not having come into
action, and two, the Yang-wei and Chao-yung, having retired
from the battle in flames, and two, the Tsi-yuen and
Kwan-chia, having deserted, we find six ships of 23,000 tons
bearing the brunt of the battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the flying squadron began to starboard, the main
squadron, which was following in fine order, kept to port.
The feint against the Kwan-ping and Ping-yuen proving
successful, the flying squadron kept to starboard and followed
the main squadron. Soon, however, it was seen that the
slower vessels of the main squadron were being left exposed
and Admiral Ito signalled for the flying squadron to starboard
again and intervene between the distressed vessels and
the enemy. Thus the main and flying squadrons moved
about the Chinese fleet in opposite directions, the former on
the inner track.</p>

<p class='c000'>This second round proved a severe one for the Chinese
fleet. The contest now assumed a desperate phase. During
the opening of the struggle attention on either side had been
paid to the enemy’s weaker ships. The two slow and defenseless
ships of the Japanese fleet, the Akagi and Saikio,
caused the Admiral much trouble, if indeed they did not
alter entirely his plan of attack. That he brought them out
of the battle at all is a great credit to his ability to manoeuver
at short notice and under fire. It is, however, inexplicable
that such ships were allowed to follow the main
squadron into the engagement.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>By two o’clock the ranks of the two struggling fleets were
considerably thinned out and the battle became simplified
though more desperate than ever, as the main squadron began
to close in on the powerful iron-clads and as the flying squadron
separated the remainder of the Chinese fleet from their
only hope of safety and scattered them broadcast over the sea.
The Akagi was now out of the fight and, under the protection of
the flying squadron, was making for the Ta-dong River. The
Hiyei, also disabled and protected by the main squadron, was
making for the same destination. The Saikio having come as
it were from the very jaws of death, when attempting to attack
the burning Yang-wei, lay between the object of her
deadly mission and the fleets, watching how the battle fared.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the Chinese side there was far more destruction, because
of the larger number of slow and inflamable ships. Of
the total, two, the Tsi-yuen and Kwan-chia, had long since
deserted as we have already said. The Yang-wei and Chao-yung
were both desperately burning. The Chih-yuen, having
passed from the Admiral’s wing to the right wing, had
attempted the most ridiculous feat of attacking the flying
squadron as the latter come to relieve the Akagi and Saikio.
Being severely hit in her foolhardy course, her commander,
evidently as revenge for going under, attempted to ram. The
guns of the fleet were instantly brought to bear upon the ill-starred
ship and, riddled with the fire of the heavy and
machine guns alike, she went under, flinging her crew into
the air as she listed the last time. A similar fate overtook
the Ping-yuen upon whom the flying squadron bore. A terrible
fire from the Yoshino riddled her burning hulk and she
too, went down like a monstrous bonfire into the tawny waters
of Yellow Sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile the struggle between the two iron-clads and
the Japanese main squadron had been raging until both the
contestants were nearly exhausted. The former, knowing
well that in them rested China’s only hope on the sea, and
equally desperate because of the cowardliness and incompetency
displayed throughout the battle by their own comrades
as well as by the determined wrath of their ancient foe,
fought to their last charge save three with undaunted heroism.
Nothing in the conflict which raged so many hours could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>have equalled the sight of the crews of the two battered iron-clads,
their ammunition far spent, meeting the last onslaught
of the main squadron as it bore down upon them for the last
time on that memorable afternoon, with perfect calm and a
purpose to go down with the ships when the ammunition
gave out.</p>

<p class='c000'>The last onslaught was made and met, but before another
could be made night had begun to fall and the Japanese, themselves
not far from exhaustion, deemed it wise to <a id='corr261.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='withraw'>withdraw</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_261.9'>withdraw</a></span>.
This battle has been called a Japanese victory and probably
with reason, though according to the dictum of modern naval
warfare a decided Japanese victory could have been achieved
only by capturing or disabling the two Chinese iron-clads
which were the soul of the Chinese fleet. Technically the
failure to do this made it a drawn battle, each side retiring
unconquered. But there is every reason to believe that this
battle, in reality, decided the Japanese supremacy over the
Yellow Sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The land battle at P’yŭng-yang and the naval battle off the
mouth of the Yalu opened the eyes of the world to the fact that
Japan was a power to be reckoned with. The incident at P‘ung
Island and the battle of <a id='corr261.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Ansan'>Asan</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_261.22'>Asan</a></span> had proved nothing except
the fact that Japan was fully prepared to go to extremities and
that the war was actually begun. It is probable that a majority
of intelligent people thought the Japanese would fall an easy
victim to the Chinese forces. On the sea China had several
war-vessels that far out-matched anything which Japan possessed
and on land she had unlimited population from which
to recruit her armies. She had enjoyed the assistance of
many foreign military and naval men in getting her army
and navy into shape, and in addition to this she had the sympathy
of Great Britain in the struggle. It was freely predicted
that the superior quickness of the Japanese might bring
her certain small victories at first but that as time went on
and China really awoke to the seriousness of the situation
a Chinese army would be put in the field which would
eventually drive the Japanese off the mainland. The Japanese
invasion of 1592 was cited to show that though momentarily
successful, the Japanese would be ultimately defeated.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>The battles of P’yŭng-yang and Yalu changed all this.
In the first place it was discovered that the Chinese, with equal
or superior numbers, could not hold a strongly defensive position
against their assailants. The Chinese had everything
in their favor so far as natural surroundings went. They
lacked the one essential and it was the demonstration of this
lack at P’yŭng-yang that made the world begin to doubt
whether the Chinese would really do what was expected of
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The battle of the Yalu, while technically a drawn battle,
proved that the <a id='corr262.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Japnese'>Japanese</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_262.11'>Japanese</a></span> could stand up against superior ships
and hold them down to a tie game. The Chinese ammunition
was exhausted and if darkness had not come on the Japanese
would have discovered this and the big Chinese vessels would
have been captured. From that day the progress of the Japanese
was an unbroken series of victories. The myth of
China’s strength was shattered and the whole history of the
Far East, if not of the world, entered upon a new and unexpected
phase.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have already mentioned that 4,000 Chinese troops
had been landed at the mouth of the Yalu to reinforce the
army that had been gathered there for the invasion of Korea.
That invasion was destined not to be carried out, for the
routed Chinese army from P’yŭng-yang came streaming north
in headlong flight and the Japanese followed them up just
fast enough to worry them but without making it necessary
to encumber themselves with prisoners. It shows how perfectly
the Japanese had gauged the calibre of the Chinese
that they should have driven them on in this contemptuous
manner. When the Japanese arrived at the Yalu they found
that the Chinese had occupied an advantageous position on
the further side and would attempt to block the advance but
it was too late to stem the tide of Japanese enthusiasm. The
passage was made with ease, the Chinese quickly put to flight
and the war left Korean territory, not to return.</p>

<p class='c000'>The subsequent operations of war are of surpassing interest
to the general historian but they cannot be called a
part of Korean history, so we shall be compelled to leave them
and go back to the peninsula, where the results of Japan’s
victories were to be keenly felt.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>Chapter XVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A great Crisis.... condition of affairs in Seoul.... flight of Chinese.... Tă-wŭn-kun
summoned to palace.... new Cabinet.... tribulations of
Min Yong-jun.... Commission on Reforms appointed.... names of
Government offices changed.... list of proposed reforms.... the currency.... new
coinage.... revenue reforms.... a national bank.... standardization
of weights and measures.... past abuses rectified.... foreign
advisers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The year 1894 marked the greatest crisis in Korean history
since the seventh century, when the kingdom of Silla
gained control of the whole peninsula. Considering the fact
that so many of the old abuses survived after the year 1894,
the above statement may seem extreme but the facts of the
case warrant it. From the early years of the Christian era
Korea had been moulded by Chinese ideas and had been
dominated by her influence. There was no time from the
very first when Korea did not consider China her suzerain.
In a sense this was natural and right. Korea had received
from China an immense number of the products of civilization.
Literature, art, science, government, religion—they had all
been practically borrowed from China. It is a thing to be marvelled
at that Korea through all these centuries has preserved
any semblance of individualism. She never would have
done so if there had not been a radical and <a id='corr263.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>ineffacable</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_263.16'>ineffacable</a></span> difference
between the Chinese and the Korean which no amount
of moulding could remove.</p>

<p class='c000'>Never once during all those centuries did Korea attempt
or desire to throw off the garment of her vassalage. And
even in this crisis of 1894 it was not thrown off through any
wish of the Korean government or people but only through
hard necessity. There had been no radical change in the
mental attitude of the great mass of Koreans which demanded
the severing of the tie which bound them to China and even
at this year of grace 1904, there is every reason to believe
that a great majority of Koreans would elect to go back under
the mild and almost nominal control of China. The change
is not one of attitude on the part of the Korean but it is the
fact that the war proved to the world the supineness of China
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>and made it forever impossible to revive her claim to suzerainty
over Korea or even, it is to be feared, to hold together her
own unwieldy bulk. The outward influence of China upon
Korea has ceased and other influences have been at work
which are slowly drawing her away from her servile obedience
to Chinese ideals. This was the first necessary step to
the final emancipation of Korea and her national regeneration.
It should be carefully noted that from the earliest
centuries the Chinese implanted in the Korean no genuine
seed of civilization and progress but simply unloaded upon her
some finished products of her civilization. These the Koreans
swallowed whole without question, unmindful of the fact that
by far the greater part of them were wholly unsuited to the
Korean temperament. The result was that as time went on
these Chinese impositions were overlaid with a pure Korean
product just as the little leaden Buddhas that are thrust into
the shell of the pearl oyster become coated over with mother-o’pearl.
Buddhism came from China but Korea has so
mingled with it her native fetichism and animism that it is
something radically different from the original stock.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now this intrinsic freedom of the Korean from Chinese
ideals argued strongly in favor of the belief that from the
year 1894 Korea would gradually cast off even the mental
vassalage and would begin to work along individual lines.
This could happen only in case the individualism of the Korean
had outlasted the deadening effects of Chinese predominance.
There are many evidences that this individualism
has survived but it must be confessed that it is in a crippled
condition and all but unable to walk alone. It is to the
process and method of this great transformation in Korean
conditions that we must now turn.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up to the time when the Japanese began active operations
in Seoul by the seizure of the palace, Korea considered
herself safe under the aegis of China. Had she not secured
the murder of Kim Ok-kyun and the return of his body
on a Chinese vessel for the purpose of wreaking upon it the
old time vengeance? Had she not invited Chinese troops into
the country in direct contravention of the agreement between
China and Japan? In every way and by every means
Korea had expressed her contempt of Japanese power and of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>Japanese interests. Under the hideously corrupt regime of
such men as Min Yong-jun the country had been going
from bad to worse until the people found it utterly impossible
to endure the oppression any longer. The provinces were in
a state of anarchy and Yuan Shih-kei, the unscrupulous
Chinese “Resident” in Seoul, stood smilingly by and watched
the tragedy without suggesting any remedy for the disease
that was destroying the country, but ready to increase the
prestige of China in the peninsula by offering troops with
which to crush the starving malcontents in the provinces.
The condition of things was about as bad as it could be, and it
was at this psychological moment that Japan lifted her hand
and at a single blow tumbled the Chinese house of cards about
their heads.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the twenty-first of July the situation in Seoul had
become unbearable for the Chinese. There was a small Chinese
force at Asan but Seoul was occupied by a strong Japanese
force and every day the outbreak of hostilities had become
more imminent. On the early morning of the 20th
Yuan Shih-kei, in a mean little sedan chair, and entirely
without escort, made his escape from the city and hastened
to Chemulpo, leaving all his nationals to shift for themselves.
His flight became known almost immediately and there was
a general scramble on the part of the Chinese merchants and
other Chinese to escape from the town. When the Chinese
Minister left Seoul their interests were put in the hands of
the British representative.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the morning of the 25th the palace was taken and
the city walls manned by the Japanese. Min Yong-jun,
who was largely responsible for the parlous condition of the
government, fled that night to the country, and found
refuge in the town of Ch’un-ch’ŭn about sixty miles east of
Seoul.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the Japanese had secured the palace Minister
Otori sought the presence of the king and assured him of
his personal safety and that of the Royal family. At the
desire of His Majesty the ex-Regent, the Tă-wŭn-kun was
invited to the palace to participate in the discussion of
plans for the future, and to allay by his presence the natural
fear of the king. It was understood by common consent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>that the former officials had all resigned and it was necessary
to form a new government. Kim Hong jip was summoned
to act as Prime Minister. He was a man of strong personality
and of progressive tendencies, altogether a valuable man
for the emergency since he had the entire confidence of the
Japanese and was a man of the highest standing in Korea.
Other leading men of progressive tendencies were called in
and a government was formed for temporary purposes
until matters could he put on a firmer footing. Min Yongijun,
Min Eung-sik, Min Hyungisik, Min Ch’i-hön, and Kim Se-geui
were declared banished to distant <ins class='correction' title='points'>points.</ins> No attempt
was made to send and arrest Min Yong-jun but the members
of the “<a id='corr266.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Reighteous'>Righteous</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_266.13'>Righteous</a></span> Army” in the country seized him and
charged him with being the main author of the disturbances,
and beat him nearly to death. An enormous amount of
money that he had carried off with him was divided up
and made away with by his followers. He barely escaped
with his life and fled to China where be gave the Chinese
advice as to the method of reasserting their authority in the
peninsula.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this same time the government recalled Yi To-jă, Sin
Keui-sŭn, Yun Ung-yŭl and others who had been in banishment
for ten years because of their espousal of the liberal
cause in 1884. The prison doors were opened and innocent
and guilty alike received amnesty.</p>

<p class='c000'>The government was not yet ready to publish its full
list of reforms, based upon the demands already made by the
Japanese Minister, but the king immediately declared that as it
was necessary to secure good men to administer the Government
in Seoul and in the provinces, the demarcation between
the upper and lower classes was a thing of the past and all
men of all grades were eligible to office, and at the same time
he declared the abolition of the great political parties and
forbade the apportionment of government offices along party
lines. The different leading offices under the government
were put in the hands of the best men that were available
and it is probable that these men formed the best government
that Korea was capable of at the time. Some of the names
were as follows: Kim Hong-jip, Pak Chöng-yang, Kim Yun-sik,
Kim Chong-han, Cho Heui-yŭn, Yi Yun-yong, Kim Ka-jin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>An Kyŭng-su, Chöng Kyöng-wŭn, Pak Chun-yang, Yi
Wŭn-göng Kim Ha-gu, Kwŭn Yŭng-jin. Yu Kil-jun, Kim
Ha-yŭng, Yi Eung-ik, Sö Sang jip. Among these names
many will be recognized as among the best that Korea has
produced in recent times.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the very next day after the Japanese took the palace
and gave a new direction to governmental affairs a special
High Commission was called together by the king to consider
the matter of reconstructing the government along the new
lines. It was composed partly of the the members the Cabinet
and partly of other <a id='corr267.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='destinguished'>distinguished</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_267.11'>distinguished</a></span> men. It was well understood
that these men were to carry out the ideas of the
Japanese authorities. Their deliberations continued for a
period of forty-one days during which time they completed a
scheme for a new government, along the following lines.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before this time there had been seven great governmental
departments, namely the <em>Eui-jung-bu</em> or State Department,
<em>Yi-jo</em> or Home Department, <em>Ho-jo</em> or Finance Department,
<a id='corr267.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'><em>Yi-jo</em></ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_267.19'>Yi-jo</a></span> or Ceremonial Department, <em>Pyŭng-jo</em> or War Department,
<em>Hyŭng-jo</em> or Law Department, <em>Kong-jo</em> or Department
of Public Works. Besides these there were the two <em>Po-ch‘ŭng</em>
or Police offices, the <em>Eui-gom-bu</em> or Supreme Court and other
lesser offices. In the new regime the seven Departments
above named were all retained excepting the Ceremonial Department
and in place of this they founded for the first time in
Korean history a genuine Educational Department coördinate
in dignity with any other of the great Departments. Besides
this the Department of Public Works was broadened
to include Agriculture and Commerce. A Police Bureau
was formed to take the place of the former two Poch’ŭngs.</p>

<p class='c000'>They also prepared a list of needed reforms in the
government.</p>

<p class='c000'>(1) From this time all Korean documents shall be dated
from the year of the present Dynasty. (This was the 503rd
year, as the Dynasty was founded in 1392).</p>

<p class='c000'>(2) Korean treaties with China shall be revised and
ministers shall be sent to the various treaty powers.</p>

<p class='c000'>(3) Class distinctions in Korea shall be wiped out and

government office.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>(4) The distinction between civil and military rank,
in favor of the former, shall be done away and they shall
stand on an equality.</p>

<p class='c000'>(5) The family and relatives of a criminal shall not be

through a memorial.</p>

<p class='c000'>(11) The long sleeves on coats, whether court dress
or common are abolished. But officials shall be authorized
to wear the sleeveless coat over the ordinary one. Soldiers’
uniforms shall continue as at present for a time but may be
changed gradually to the foreign style.</p>

<p class='c000'>(12) The people shall be given one month in which to
prepare for these changes.</p>

<p class='c000'>(13) The Police Bureau shall be an adjunct of the
Home Department.</p>

<p class='c000'>(14) Officials shall not ride on the streets in the high
one-wheeled chair nor shall they be accompanied by a large
retinue, nor shall the attendants call out for people to clear
the way.</p>

<p class='c000'>(15) No one shall be obliged to dismount when passing
an official nor to show any other sign of servility.</p>

<p class='c000'>(16) The Prime Minister shall have only four attendants,
the Vice Prime Minister and all the other ministers of
state shall have three, the vice-ministers shall have two and
the secretaries one.</p>

<p class='c000'>(17) Even <a id='corr268.37'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='eunucks'>eunuchs</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_268.37'>eunuchs</a></span>, if they are men of ability, shall be
eligible for office.</p>

<p class='c000'>(18) The law that relatives may not sue each other at
law shall be abrogated except for very near relatives, and
feuds between families shall be given up.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>(19) All debts of long standing shall be cancelled (such
as debts contracted by a father who is now dead or by
relatives).</p>

<p class='c000'>(20) There shall be but eleven official grades (in place
of the eighteen which there had been formerly).</p>

<p class='c000'>(21) There shall be no longer any outcast class in
Korea but butchers, contortionists, acrobats, dancing girls,
sorceresses and exorcists shall all be considered equal to
others before the law.</p>

<p class='c000'>(22) Even after holding high office a man may engage
in business or other occupation, at his pleasure.</p>

<p class='c000'>(23) The matter of the national examination shall be
reserved for fuller discussion.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not necessary to go into an analysis of these proposed
reforms. They speak for themselves; some of them
were necessary and others were the reverse. But they form
a striking commentary on the condition of affairs in Korea
at the time. Whatever may have been the defects of this
plan it was an honest and strenuous attempt on the part of
the best statesmen Korea could produce and it promised
much. If its terms could have been carried out it would
have proved an inestimable blessing to the people of the peninsula,
but one can easily see that some of the proposals
struck at the very fabric of Korean society. For instance
the attempt to make acrobats, dancing-girls and <em>mudang</em> the
social equals of reputable people was of course absurd. The
submerged classes cannot be enfranchised by a stroke of the
pen. What Korea needed then and needs still is education.
This alone will make fundamental reforms possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in August the currency of the country received
serious attention. Foreign money was in use in the open
ports but the general currency of the country consisted of
two kinds of perforated “cash,” one called <em>yŭp</em>, each piece of
which was called one cash, and the other called <em>tang-o</em> or the
“five fitter.” These represented five cash each. The <em>yŭp</em>
was the old, genuine and universally recognized money of
the country. It was only in Seoul, the open ports and
on the great thoroughfares near Seoul that the <em>tang-o</em>
circulated. This <em>tang-o</em> was a debased coin made
in 1883 and several succeeding years. At first each of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>the <em>tang-o</em> exchanged for five of the <em>yŭp</em> but within a few
months the <em>tang-o</em> fell to an inevitable discount which increased
year by year from 1883 until 1894, when it was
found that they were practically the same. Successive
issues of the <em>yŭp</em> had deteriorated the quality and size of the
coin until it was worth only a fifth of its face value. For
this reason the Government declared in August that the <em>yŭp</em>
and the <em>tang-o</em> were on a par and that no distinction should
be made between them. The fair thing would have been for
the Government to redeem the debased <em>tang-o</em> at its face value
but of course no one could expect this under the circumstances.
It had proved an indirect tax upon the people equal to four
fifths its face value.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the same time the national financiers determined to
place in the hands of the people a foreign style coinage,
and soon a one cent copper piece, a nickel five cent piece
and silver coins of twenty cent and one dollar denominations,
which had been in process of manufacture since
1901, were issued. A few of them had been issued a year
or two before but had not been well received. Now
they passed current and were used, but it was soon found
that the silver coins were being bought up and hoarded by
wealthy people who placed no faith in banks, and soon not
a single native silver piece could be found anywhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the intention of the Commission to withdraw from
circulation all the old cash and replace it with the foreign
style money. How <a id='corr270.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='absud'>absurd</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_270.27'>absurd</a></span> this was will be seen at a glance.
There is nothing else that people are so timid about as their
money and the bare idea of making such a sweeping change
was preposterous, but the Japanese were behind all these reforms
and, while their intentions were of the best, they made
the serious mistake in this as in other attempted reforms of
hurrying things too fast.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another important problem attacked by the Reform
Commission was that of the revenue. It had always been
customary to pay taxes in rice, linen, beans, cotton and a
hundred other <a id='corr270.37'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='commodies'>commodities</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_270.37'>commodities</a></span>, but it was decided now to change
all this and have the revenue turned into cash in the country
and sent up to the capital. In order to do this it was necessary
to have banking facilities in the provinces and it was planned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>to establish a great national bank with branches all over the
country.</p>

<p class='c000'>An attempt was also made to effect an inspection and
standardization of all the weights and measures in the
country.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was ordered that every house in the land should have
its owner’s name and occupation and the number of his family
posted in a conspicuous place on his front gate. This was
to facilitate the work of postal, police and census officials and
agents.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the reforms that was carried out was the sending
of students abroad to acquire an education.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was decreed that all land or houses that had been illegally
seized by unscrupulous people in power during the
past ten years should be restored to their rightful owners.
Many officials in Seoul, well known in foreign circles, lost
large fractions of their wealth because of this decree.</p>

<p class='c000'>The policy was adopted of engaging foreign advisers for
the various great Departments of State and as a result of this
a number of foreigners were employed. Some of them had
already been some time in the service of the government.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>Chapter XIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Ex-Regent.... The new Cabinet.... the <em>Tong-hak</em> pacified.... The
Tă-wŭn-kun retires.... Japan declares war.... Korea abrogates all
treaties with China.... Pak Yong-hyo returns.... his memorial.... he
is pardoned.... Chinese excesses in the north.... new Korean-Japanese

again.... Prince Eui-wha goes to Japan.... Count Inouye comes.... amnesty
to offenders of 1884.... Dr. Jaisohn comes.... Army reform.... the
privy Council.... the King’s Oath.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Tă-wŭn-kun, the former Regent, was now a prominent
factor in the government and the well known strength of
his personality did much to give stability to the new regime.
The Queen necessarily retired from active participation in
politics for the time being and there was apparent promise
of better days to come. The new cabinet chosen at this time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>was a curious mixture of progressive and conservative men.
It was composed of Kim Hong-jip, Kim Yun-sik, O Yun-jung,
Pak Chöng-yang and An Kyöng-su representing the
progressive wing and Min Yong-dal, Sŭ Chŭng-sun, Yi
Kyu-wŭn, Yun Yong-gu and Um Se-yŭng representing
the conservative wing. Among the secondary officials some
were progressive and some conservative. This apparent
blending of the various factions was a hopeful sign outwardly
but it had no real significance. All were appointed by permission
of the Japanese and they worked together only because it
was useless to oppose. But the same intrinsic hostility remained
and only needed opportunity to manifest itself. It
was the calm of repression rather than of genuine reconciliation,
and it helped to prove that there is no hope for good
government in Korea by Koreans until the country has secured
the benefit of genuine education.</p>

<p class='c000'>These reforms that were proposed had the apparent sanction
of His Majesty, as is proved by the fact that after their
proposal he called all the high officials to the palace and made
them a speech in which he referred to this as a splendid opportunity
to make a radical and beneficent change in the government,
and laid it as a sacred duty upon the officials to carry
out the reforms, and he declared that he, too, would become
a new king and do his part in bringing about the desired
renovation of the land.</p>

<p class='c000'>In spite of the previous declaration that the <em>tong-hak</em>
uprising was at an end there was much unrest especially in
the south and the <em>tong-hak</em> were really as ready as ever to
take the offensive. For this reason the king sent a high
official to Kyüng-sang Province to make an attempt at
pacification and told the people that the trouble was because
of his own lack of virtue and begged them to be patient a
little longer until the reforms could be carried out. The people
were pleased, especially with the promise that slavery
should be discontinued and that the barriers between
the classes should be broken down. The fact that this effort
on the part of the king was entirely successful shows that
the <em>tong-hak</em> were not anarchists or banditti but were merely
desperate citizens who required some assurance that certain
changes would be made so that life would be bearable.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>A word is necessary as to the attitude of the Tă-wŭn-kun
toward these reforms. He had been called to the palace
and put in a responsible advisory position by the Japanese
but he was not the sort of man to hold an empty honor or to
pose as a mere figure-head. Several of the proposed reforms
were distasteful to him but when he found that his objections
carried no weight he retired to his private house in disgust.
It took him only a few weeks to discover that his elevation
had been merely a formality.</p>

<p class='c000'>The month of August was an anxious one in Korea.
The battle of Asan had been fought on the 28th and 29th of
July and it was known that there would be a decisive battle
fought at P‘yŭng Yang in the near future. Foreign opinion
was divided as to the probabilities, some people believing
that the Japanese would sweep every thing before them and
others being equally sure that the Chinese would win.</p>

<p class='c000'>But in spite of the state of anxiety and unrest the month
of August saw some important results accomplished in civil
matters. The Commission on Reforms were at work on their
scheme until about the tenth of the month. It was on August
1st that Japan formally declared war on China and a few
days later troops began to pour in by way of Chemulpo and
join those already here.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was on August 16 that there occurred the formal act
of casting off Chinese suzerainty. On that day the Korean
government declared all treaties hitherto signed between
itself and China to be abrogated and all political connection
between the two countries to be at an end. The Japanese
Minister had already on June 28th demanded from the government
an expression of its attitude toward China and had
received the answer that Korea considered herself an independent
power. This was now followed up by a definite
diplomatic rupture between the two and, probably forever,
the question of Chinese political predominance in the peninsula
was disposed of.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was about the 20th of August that Pak Yong-hyo, the
refugee in Japan since his participation in the attempted <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</span></em>
of 1884, was brought to Seoul <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">incognito</span></em> by the Japanese. He
had long since been declared an arch-traitor by the Korean
government, his house had been razed to the ground and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>family dispersed. For almost ten years he had enjoyed
asylum in Japan and had been treated with great consideration
by the Japanese who rightly saw in him a man of strong
personality, settled convictions and a genuine loyalty to the
best interests of his native land. His worst enemies would
probably grant that he falls below none in his desire to see
Korea prosperous and enlightened. It was the methods
adopted that made all the trouble and drove him into exile.</p>

<p class='c000'>At first he remained in hiding in the Japanese quarter
but from that point of vantage he sent a long memorial to
the King relating the fact of his high ancestry and the fact
that it was purely in the interests of Korea that he participated
in the <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">emeute</span></em> of 1884. He had been however, unsuccessful
and was branded as a traitor, compelled to fly the country
and see his house broken up. Now that the country had fallen
upon such critical times and the King had determined to
effect a radical change in affairs it was a cause of utmost
rejoicing to him and he could not help coming back even
though it cost his life. He begged to see the King’s face once
more, to be allowed to collect and bury the bones of his
relatives and be given back his life which had been forfeited.
If then the King should wish to use him again he would be
at the service of His Majesty.</p>

<p class='c000'>To this plea the King listened, whether from preference
or out of consideration for the Japanese, and replied that the
petitioner was forgiven and might resume his former status
as a Korean citizen. A number of memorials immediately
poured into the palace urging that Pak Yong-hyo be executed
as a traitor, but as the decree of pardon had already gone
forth these memorials were ignored.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fall of P’yŭng-yang before the victorious Japanese on
September 15-17 and the flight of the Chinese inflicted great
sufferings upon the Koreans in the north. The Chinese
followed their usual medieval tactics and pillaged right and
left. The local magistrates and governors fled to places of
safety and the people survived the best they could. The
government hastened to send a high official to the north to
calm the excitement and counteract the disintegrating effects
of the Chinese flight. At the same time the perfect orderliness
of the Japanese army began to be understood by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>people, and between these two agencies the northern province
speedily settled down to its former status. The city of P’yŭng-yang
had been almost deserted by its 60,000 or more of
people and it was many months before the town resumed its
normal status.</p>

<p class='c000'>As August drew to an end the Japanese deemed the time
ripe for completing the purposed union with Korea and on
the 26th there appeared a provisional treaty between the two
countries, which was not an offensive and defensive alliance
but one in which Japan guaranteed the independence of
Korea and Korea engaged to look to Japan for advice and to
aid her in every possible way. The nature of this agreement
was practically the same as that made between the
same countries at the opening of the Japan-Russia War in
1904. In it Japan once more emphasized the independence
of Korea which she had consistently championed ever since
the Japanese-Korean treaty was signed in 1876.</p>

<p class='c000'>The month of September opened with the arrival of
Marquis Saionji with presents and a friendly message from
the Emperor of Japan. The visit was merely a complimentary
one and seems to have been devoid of great political significance.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was evident that Japanese influence was overwhelmingly
predominant in Seoul and as the government had committed
itself to the policy of selecting advisers for its various
departments there was reason to believe that most of these
places would be filled by Japanese and that they would so
predominate numerically as to seriously impair the autonomy
of the government. As foreign powers had concluded
treaties with Korea on the basis of equality, this possibility
became a matter of concern to them and through their representatives
here they protested against the employment of an
undue number of assistants from any one nationality.
Whether there ever was any such danger as was anticipated
we cannot say, but this preventive measure was successful
at any rate and the apparent independence of the government
was never shaken.</p>

<p class='c000'>The month of October saw the Chinese driven across
the Yalu and order restored in a measure on Korean soil, but
it also saw the resurgence of the <em>tong-hak</em> in the south.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>These malcontents had been temporarily cowed by the coming
of Chinese and Japanese troops but now they seem to have
discovered that the Chinese and Japanese were too busy with
each other to attend to the civil troubles in the interior of
Korea. So they broke out much worse than ever and the
principal anxiety of the month in Seoul was the putting
down of the serious insurrection. Sin Chŭng-heui, the
highest Korean general, was sent south to Kong-ju with
three thousand Korean troops to meet a strong body of
<em>tong-hak</em> who were reported to be marching on Seoul. A
few days later there was a series of fights at various points
throughout the province, notably at Kong-ju, Ung-jin,
U-gum Hill, Yi-in village, Hyo Harbor, Sö-san and Hong-ju.
About two hundred Japanese troops aided the government
forces and at every point the government troops were successful.
Some of the fights were very severe. It is probable
that there were some 20,000 <em>tong-hak</em> in all, but they were
a mere rabble compared with the well armed and at least
partially drilled government troops. A large number of the
<em>tong-hak</em> leaders were captured and brought to Seoul. Many
were also executed in the country, for the generals were
given the power of life and death for the time being.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having been thus dispersed the <em>tong-hak</em> moved southward
and took their stand at various places in Chulla and
southern Ch’ung-ch’ŭng Provinces. Their main point was the
town of No-sŭng where for eleven days they continued to revile
the government and put up placards defying the government
troops. The Korean troops moved on them and soon had them
on the retreat again. Other encounters took place at various
points but by this time the leading spirits in the <em>tong-hak</em>
movement had been captured. Among these were Chŭn
Nok-tu and Kim Kă-nam. They were brought to Seoul and
the latter was executed and the former is said to have been
taken to Japan, but there is some doubt as to his fate. Two
<em>tong-hak</em> leaders named Kim Chöng-hyŭn and Au Seung-gwan
were beheaded at Su-wŭn and their heads were raised
high on poles and the people told to take warning from them.
This put an end to the <em>tong-hak</em> except for some small
sporadic movements which amounted to nothing. But the
<em>tong-hak</em>, like the poor, we have ever with us,—<em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in posse</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>Prince Eui-wha was sent to Tokyo to return the visit
of Marquis Saionji and present the compliments of the King
to the Emperor of Japan.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Japanese government evidently realized the necessity
of having an exceptionally strong representation in
Seoul, for Count Inouye arrived on the 20th of October and
assumed the duties of minister. He had more than once helped
to straighten out matters in Korea and he had the confidence
of the king and of the people as well. No better appointment
could have been made under the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c000'>The end of October was signalized by the murder of
Kim Hak-u, the vice-Minister of Law, who was one of the
strongest and best men that the reform movement had
brought to the front. He was stabbed at night in his house.</p>

<p class='c000'>The month of November witnessed some progress in the
reconstruction of the government. The pardon of Pak
Yong-hyo had been the sign for a general amnesty to all
those who had forfeited their rights in 1884. Sŭ Chă-p‘il,
known better as Dr. Philip Jaisohn, who had been many
years in America and had become a naturalized citizen of
that country, had come back to Korea quietly and was awaiting
an opportunity to make himself useful. Sŭ Kwang-böm
had also come back from exile in Japan and others who had
been kept sedulously in the background because of their
liberal tendencies all came forward and received recognition
by the king and were put again in line of political preferment.
So rapid was the progress of this movement that by the middle
of December the king found himself moved to form a new
cabinet composed almost entirely of men who had been foremost
in the attempt of 1884, as the following list will show.
The Ministers were Kim Hong-jip, Yu Kil-jun, Pak Yong-hyo,
Sŭ Kwang-böm, Cho Heui-yŭn, Sin Keui-sŭn, Um Se-yŭng,
O Yun-jung, Kim Yun-sik, Pak Chong-yang and Yi
Cha-myn. At the same time Dr. Jaisohn was employed as
adviser to the Privy Council for a term of ten years.</p>

<p class='c000'>This era of change also affected the Korean Army. The
various regiments in Seoul, numbering five, had heretofore
been under wholly independent and separate commands but
now they were all placed in the hands of the War Department,
their names were changed and many men were dropped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>because of age and younger men were appointed in their
places. The tactics that had been taught were given up and
the Japanese tactics were introduced instead.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have referred to the Privy Council. This was an
advisory board or council composed of some forty men whose
business it was to take up and discuss all important government
matters, and it was supposed to have a sort of veto
power. It exercised this power for about three years but lost
it when the Independence Club was overthrown. The entire
personnel of this Council was progressive and pro-Japanese.
There can be no question that the machinery was now all
complete whereby Korea could be governed properly. There
was no great obstacle in the way. All that was needed was
that no serious blunders should be made and that the Japanese
should act firmly but wisely. At the same time there was
a strong pressure being exerted behind the scenes in the opposite
direction and, as we shall see, not without effect. And
so the year 1894 came to a close and the new year opened
with great promise of better things to come. On the fifth of
the new year the king went to the Ancestral Temple and in
the most solemn manner took an oath to carry out the reforms
already determined upon and partly inaugurated. It
is unnecessary to give this oath in full but only to enumerate
the principal points. After a long preamble in which the
king declares his intention to uphold the government as an
independent one he guarantees specifically that—</p>

<p class='c000'>(1) All thought of dependence on China shall be put
away.</p>

<p class='c000'>(2) The line of succession and rank in the Royal Family
shall be clearly marked.</p>

not interfere in government matters.</p>

<p class='c000'>(4) The affairs of the Royal Household shall be kept
quite distinct from the general government.</p>

<p class='c000'>(5) The duties of Ministers and other officials shall be
clearly defined.</p>

<p class='c000'>(6) Taxes shall be regulated by law and additions to
them are forbidden.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>(7) The assessment, collection and disbursement of the
national revenue shall be in the hands of the Finance Department.</p>

<p class='c000'>(8) The expenses of the Royal Household shall be reduced,
that the example may become a law to the other departments.</p>

<p class='c000'>(9) An annual budget shall be made out so as to regulate
the management of the revenue.</p>

<p class='c000'>(10) The laws governing local officials shall be speedily
revised in order that their various functions may be differentiated.</p>

<p class='c000'>(11) Intelligent young men shall be sent to foreign
countries to study.</p>

<p class='c000'>(12) A method for the instruction of military officers
and a mode of enlistment for soldiers shall be determined
upon.</p>

<p class='c000'>(13) Civil and criminal law must be clearly defined and
strictly adhered to and imprisonment and fines in excess of
the law are prohibited.</p>

<p class='c000'>(14) Men shall be employed irrespective of their origin.
Ability alone shall determine a man’s eligibility whether in
Seoul or in the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The year 1895 was big with history. Its events created
a strong and lasting impression upon the whole Korean people
and it is in the light of these events that the whole
subsequent history of the country must be interpreted. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>year opened in apparent prosperity. The king had taken
oath to govern according to enlightened principles and had
exhorted his officials to adhere strictly to the reform program,
protesting that if he himself failed to do so it would
be an offence against Heaven. The Tă-wŭn-gun had retired
from public life but as his son, the brother of the king, was
Minister of the Household and his grandson Yi Chun-yong
held a position near the king, there can be no doubt that in
a private way the Tă-wŭn-gun exercised fully as much influence
as he had done while in active office. It is necessary
to bear in mind that the enmity of the queen against the
ex-Regent extended to the sons of the latter and in spite of
the terms of the king’s oath constant pressure was brought
to bear upon the king from that direction. Whatever be
the reason, we find that in January Yi Chun-yong was sent
to Japan as Korean Minister, an act that was really in favor
of the anti-Regent faction since it temporarily removed one
of the chief actors from the immediate stage.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the king had sworn to pay personal attention to the
details of government it was deemed advisable to remove the
cabinet meeting place to the palace itself. Whether this
was in accord with the spirit of the reforms may be doubted,
for it worked directly for the complete centralization of
power which later caused a reversal of the whole governmental
policy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The progress of the so-called reforms went on apace.
The outside, the integuments, were changed, whatever may
or may not have happened in the inner mind. The long
baggy sleeves which had distinguished the true <em>yang-ban</em>
were done away and the side-openings of the long coats were
sewed up. The width of the hat brims was curtailed and
other minor changes were effected. A salutary change was
made by putting power into the hands of the ministers of
state to carry out the work of their respective offices according
to law without referring every thing to the central government,
excepting in very important cases where it affected
other departments. The immemorial customs regarding the
salutations of inferiors to superiors and <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</span></em> were
largely done away and more democratic rules formulated.
The Home Minister undertook to correct many abuses in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>country, to ferret out cases where cultivated land returned
no revenue, because of the indirection of the <em>ajŭns</em>, and by
this means the revenue of the government was very largely
augmented.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the advice of the leading members of the Cabinet
His Majesty adopted the title of <em>Ta-gun-ju Pye-ha</em> (<img class="inline" src="images/ta-gun-ju.jpg" alt="ta-gun-ju" />)
<img class="inline" src="images/pye-ha.jpg" alt="pye-ha" /> in place of his former title of <em>Chon-ha</em> (<img class="inline" src="images/chon-ha.jpg" alt="chon-ha" />). This
elevated him to a position somewhat higher than that of
<em>Wang</em> (<img class="inline" src="images/wang.jpg" alt="wang" />) but still much lower than the title of emperor
which he later assumed. All other members of the Royal
Family were likewise elevated one degree.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this time a radical change was made in the manner
of punishing criminals. The cruel forms of execution and
of torture which had always prevailed were done away and
more humane methods instituted. Decapitation was done
away and strangulation substituted. This worked no relief
for the criminal but the horrible spectacle of public decapitation
was relegated to the past.</p>

<p class='c000'>A large number of men who had been banished or who
had fled the country because of connection with the troubles
of 1884 and other years, were pardoned and their relatives
were again recognized as eligible to office.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the native New Year which occurred in February the
king issued an important edict saying that office should be
given not only to men of noble blood but to others of good
character and attainments, and he ordered that such men be
selected and sent up from the country as candidates for
official position. This was very pleasing to the country
people and was hailed as a genuine sign of political renovation.
At the same time the ancient arch outside the West
Gate was demolished. This arch was the only remaining
sign of Chinese suzerainty and its demolition broke the last
visible thread which bound Korea to her great patron. We
say visible advisedly, for there can be no doubt that the intrinsic
loyalty of the vast majority of Koreans to China was
still practically unimpaired.</p>

<p class='c000'>On February thirteenth Yun Chi-ho returned from
many years’ sojourn in America and China where he had
gained a genuine insight into truly enlightened government,
and his return to Korea would have been a most happy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>augury had there been enough enlightened sentiment in
the country to form a basis for genuine as distinguished
from superficial reform.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile the Japanese were carrying everything before
them in Manchuria and the end had now come. The Korean
government therefore sent a special envoy to the Japanese
headquarters on the field at Hai-cheng, congratulating them
upon their brilliant successes. Soon after this the war terminated
with the treaty of Shimonoseki by the terms of which
China ceded to Japan southern Manchuria, and the island of
Formosa, abjured all interest in Korea and paid an enormous
indemnity. The result astonished the Koreans but so strong
was the feeling in favor of China that very many still clung
to the idea that China would pay the money and then go to
work preparing for a much greater struggle with the victorious
Japanese.</p>

<p class='c000'>Since the year 1456 Buddhist monks had been forbidden
to enter Seoul. This was part of the general policy of this
dynasty to give Buddhism no political foothold. Now the
Japanese secured from the government a reinstatement of
the Buddhists in their original position and for the first time
in four centuries and a half the mendicant monk with
his wooden gong and rosary begged on the streets of
Seoul.</p>

<p class='c000'>In April a great misfortune overtook the house of the
ex-Regent. His grandson, Yi Chun-yong, nephew to the
king, was arrested and charged with having connived with
<em>tonghaks</em> and others to depose the king and assume the reins
of power. It was not shown that Yi Chun-yong had been a
main mover in the scheme or that he had even favored the
idea, but the very fact that his name had been used in such
a connection was enough to send him into banishment on
the island of Kyo-dong, off Kang-wha. Four other men connected
with this affair were executed. This was a severe
blow to the ex-Regent and did much to bring him to the point
which made possible the terrible events of the following
October.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sixth of June witnessed a great celebration in Seoul,
which has gone down in history as Independence Day. A fete
was held in the “Old Palace” which exceeded in brilliancy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>any similar demonstration since the opening of Korea to
foreign relations.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was inevitable that, from the moment of his arrival in
Korea, Pok Yong-hyo should be at sword’s points with the
Tă-wŭn-gun, for the returned refugee represented the radical
wing of the reform party, which the ex-Regent had always
bitterly opposed; and besides the presence of such a strong
man would necessarily subtract from the influence of the
aged but autocratic prince. It is probable that the Japanese
brought Pak Yong-hyo back to Korea under the <a id='corr283.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='inpression'>impression</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_283.10'>impression</a></span>
that he would prove a willing instrument in their hands, but
they soon discovered that he had ideas and opinions of his
own and that he was working rather for Korea than for
Japan. He failed to fall in with some of the plans which
would help the Japanese but at the expense of Korea and, in
fine, he became something of an embarrassment to his former
benefactors. Meanwhile the king and queen were both attached
to him, and this for several reasons. He was a near
relative of the king and would have no cause for desiring a
change in the status of the reigning house; in the second
place he was a determined enemy of the Tă-wŭn-gun, and in
the third place he was sure to work against a too liberal
policy toward the Japanese. This attitude of increasing
friendliness between him and the Royal family was a further
cause of uneasiness to the Japanese, although Count Inouye
himself had done much to win the good will of the queen.
Finally Pak Yong-hyo had won the lasting gratitude of the
king and queen by exposing the machinations of Yi Chun-yong.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ex-Regent was determined that Pak Yong-hyo
should be gotten out of the way. To this end he concocted
a scheme which, with the probable sanction of the Japanese,
seemed to promise success. He laid before the king certain
grave charges of treason against Pak, which, though not
believed either by the king or the queen, convinced them
that it would be impossible to shield him from probable destruction;
for the people still called him a traitor, the ex-Regent
would spare no pains to see him put out of the way and it
was evident that the Japanese would not take any strong
measures to protect him. The queen called him up and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>advised him to make good his escape before action could be
taken on the charge of treason. He complied and forthwith
escaped again to Japan. He had not as yet broken with
the Japanese and they were doubtless glad to help him away.
It was early in July that he passed off the stage, perhaps for
ever, and thus there were lost to Korea the services of one of
the most genuinely patriotic Koreans of modern times. If the
Japanese could have determinedly put the ex-Regent in the
background and allowed Pak Yong-hyo to work out his
plans on terms of amity with the Royal family all the evils
which followed might easily have been averted. It was this
act, as we believe, of allowing the ex-Regent to carry out
his scheme of personal revenge that caused the whole trouble
and there never was a time, before or since, when brighter
hopes for Korea were more ruthlessly sacrificed.</p>

<p class='c000'>But progressive measures kept on apace and during July
the government issued new and important mining, quarantine
and army regulations and organized a domestic postal system.
A valuable mining concession in the district of Un-san in the
north was granted to an American syndicate, a transaction
that has proved the most profitable, at least to the foreigner,
of any attempt to open up the resources of Korea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near the end of the month Korea suffered the misfortune
of seeing Count Inouye retire from the Legation in
Seoul and return to Japan. Never did the Japanese have
such need of a strong and upright man in Seoul and never
had a Japanese Minister in Seoul opportunity for greater
distinction. There are those who believe that he despaired
of accomplishing anything so long as the two opposing factions
in Seoul were led by personalities so strong and so implacable
in their mutual hatred as the queen and the ex-Regent.
It is not unlikely that he felt that until one or
other of these should be permanently removed from the field
of action there could be no real opportunity for the renovation
of Korea. This by no means implies that he desired
such removal to be effected by forcible means but it is not
unnatural to suppose that he must have given expression to
the conviction as to the futility of doing anything under
existing conditions in the peninsula. There have been some
who have believed that the Japanese authorities in Tokyo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>determined upon the removal of the obstacle in Seoul by any
means in their power. Subsequent events gave some color
to this surmise but we cannot and do not believe that the
Japanese government was a party to the plot which ended in
the tragedy of the following October but that a fanatical and
injudicious Japanese Minister to Korea privately gave his
sanction to an act which the Japanese government would
have sternly forbidden had they been consulted.</p>

<p><em>THE AMERICAN MINES AT TA-BA-WI.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The summer of 1895 witnessed the first serious epidemic
of cholera in Korea since the far more destructive one of
1886. Special plague hospitals were erected in Seoul and in
spite of their temporary and inadequate nature the foreign
protestant missionaries of Seoul, who were in charge, accomplished
very much in the way of local relief. It is impossible
to say what the total mortality in Seoul was, to say nothing
of the country at large, but it is probable that ten or twelve
thousand people died in the Capital before the subsidence of
the epidemic.</p>

<p class='c000'>The forces which worked to the expulsion of Pok Yong-hyo
also operated to curtail the term of banishment of Yi
Chun-yung who was recalled from Kyo-dong Island on
August 6th, but even the ex-Regent could not secure the
residence of his grandson in Seoul, so he sent the young man
to Japan, since which time he has been numbered with the
political refugees and has never been able to think of returning
to his native land. After the departure of Count
Inouye, who had enjoyed the partial confidence of the queen,
the ex-Regent’s prospects improved to such an extent that
several of the ministers of state who were well affected toward
Her Majesty were removed and others substituted; especially
significant was the removal of the king’s brother Yi Chŭ-myŭn
from the Ministry of the Household. As he was the
son of the ex-Regent, this would seem to be a defeat for that
faction but, in fact, his removal from that position was a
necessary step to the carrying out of the dangerous plot
which was already being formulated in the mind of the
queen’s determined enemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>This summer, which witnessed so many curious contradictions,
was further distinguished by a determined effort
in the line of education. The Educational Department projected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>a Normal school and a beginning was made. One
hundred and seventeen young men were sent to study in
Japan and other measures of lesser importance were carried
out.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the first day of September Viscount Miura arrived
from Japan to assume the duties of Minister. Over a month
had elapsed since the departure of Count Inouye. The
Viscount was an <a id='corr286.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='entuhsiastic'>enthusiastic</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_286.8'>enthusiastic</a></span> Buddhist and evidently belonged
to the old rather than the new Japan. He was, withal,
a strenuous man and is said to have considered the settlement
of the Korean difficulties merely a matter of prompt and
vigorous action. At the time of his arrival the ex-Regent
was living at his summer-house near the river and from the
very first he was in close relations with the new Japanese
Minister. It was quite evident that the latter had espoused
the cause of the ex-Regent as against the queen and that
instead of trying to close the breach which was constantly
widening between these two <a id='corr286.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='powerfnl'>powerful</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_286.18'>powerful</a></span> personages he was preparing
to make use of this estrangement to further what he
supposed to be the interests of Japan. Min Yong-whan, the
most powerful of the queen’s friends, was sent to America
as Minister; and everything was ready for the <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</span></em> which
had undoubtedly been determined upon. From the mass of
conflicting evidence, charge and counter charge, it is difficult
to escape the following conclusion. There were two different
policies held by political parties in Japan as to the best
way to handle the Korean question; one was what we may
call the radical policy which advocated strong measures and
the instant and complete overthrow of all opposition to the
will of Japan in the peninsula; the other, or conservative,
policy looked to the attainment of the same object by gradual
and pacific means. It seems that the failure of Count Inouye
to accomplish anything definite in the line of a settlement of
internal dissentions at Seoul resulted in the appointment of
Viscount Miura as an exponent of the extreme radical
policy. He was supposed to do prompt work but what that
work would be perhaps neither he nor his constituency saw
clearly before his arrival on the <a id='corr286.38'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sceue'>scene</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_286.38'>scene</a></span>. It would be going
much too far to say that the assassination of the queen was
once thought of, and yet it is more than likely that those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>most conversant with conditions in Seoul felt that by some
means or other her enormous influence must be permanently
checked and that affairs must be so managed that she should
have nothing more to do in the handling of questions of
state. How this was to be accomplished neither Miura nor
any of his advisers knew until he came and looked over the
field.</p>

<p class='c000'>For this reason it is easy to see how the ex-Regent would
be the first man in Korea with whom the Japanese Minister
would wish to consult, and it is certain that the Tă-wŭn-gun
would have but one word to say as to the solution of the
difficulty. His experience of twenty years had convinced
him that there was only one way to accomplish the object
which the Minister had in view and while Viscount Miura
naturally shrunk from adopting that course it would seem
he too was at last convinced that it was the only feasible
plan. That he actually advised it in the first instance we do
not believe, but that he fell in with the plan which others
suggested and which they offered to carry through without
his personal intervention there can be no doubt whatever.
Nor can there be any question as to where the responsibility
for the tragedy rests; not with the Japanese Government,
surely, except in-so-far as its appointment of such a man to
the difficult post of Minister to Seoul may reflect upon its
wisdom.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has sometimes been hinted that Count Inouye upon
his return to Japan advocated some such policy as that
which was carried out by Marquis Miura but there is nothing
to indicate that this is other than a libel, for the whole
career of that able statesman gives the lie to such suspicions
and his dispatches to his government show the very opposite
spirit from that intimated in these slanderous reports. For
instance we have the extract from his reports read in the
Japanese Parliament in which he says:</p>

<p class='c012'>On one occasion the queen observed to me, “It was a
matter of extreme regret to me that the overtures made by
me toward Japan were rejected. The Tă-wŭn-gun, on the
other hand, who showed his unfriendliness toward Japan,
was <a id='corr286.39'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='assissted'>assisted</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_286.39'>assisted</a></span> by the Japanese Minister to rise in power.”
In reply to this I gave as far as I could an explanation of
these things to the queen and after allaying her suspicions I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>further explained that it was the true and sincere desire of the
emperor and government of Japan to place the independence
of Korea on a firm basis and in the meantime to strengthen
the Royal House of Korea. In the event of any member of
the Royal family, or indeed any Korean, attempting treason
against the Royal House, I gave the assurance that the Japanese
Government would not fail to protect the Royal
House even by force of arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>This unequivocal promise of protection was made by
Count Inouye just before his departure for Japan and we do
not and cannot believe that he expressed anything but his
honest sentiments and those of the government that was
back of him. It has been urged that the action of the Japanese
Government in acquitting Viscount Miura in the face of
the evidence given proves the complicity of that government
in the outrage and its previous knowledge that it was to be
perpetrated, but this does not necessarily follow. That government
was doubtless unwilling to stultify itself by acknowledging
that its accredited minister to Korea was actually
guilty of the crime indicated in the charge. This attempt to
evade the responsibility was of course futile. There was no
escape from the dilemma in which that government was
placed but the deduction that it was <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">particeps criminis</span></em> in the
events of October 8th is unbelievable. It was the work of
Viscount Miura and of his staff and of them alone, as is
shown by the following extract from the <a id='corr288.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Decison'>Decision</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_288.26'>Decision</a></span> of the Japanese

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>We append the decision of the Hiroshima Court in full
as it gives the fullest and probably the most nearly correct
account of the events which led up to the assassination of
the queen. It reads as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Okamoto Ryunosuke, Adviser to the Korean Departments
of War and the Household, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Miura Goro, Vicount, Sho Sammi, First class order,
Lieutenant General, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sugimura Fukashi, Sho Rokui, First Secretary of Legation,
and forty-five others.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Having, in compliance with the request of the Public
Procurator conducted preliminary examinations in the case
of murder and sedition brought against the above-mentioned
Okamoto Ryunosuke and forty-seven others and that of wilful
homicide brought against Hirayama Iwawo, we find as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“The accused, Miura Goro, assumed his official duties as
His Imperial Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister
Plenipotentiary at Seoul on Sept. 1st, 1895. According to
his observations, things in Korea were tending in the wrong
direction. The court was daily growing more and more arbitrary,
and attempting wanton interferance with the conduct
of state affairs. Disorder and confusion were in this way introduced
into the system of administration that had just been
reorganized under the guidance and advice of the Imperial
government. The court went so far in turning its face upon
Japan that a project was mooted for disbanding the <em>Kunrentai</em>
troops, drilled by Japanese officers, and for punishing
their officers. Moreover a report came to the knowledge of
the said Miura that the court had under contemplation a
scheme for usurping all political power by degrading some
and killing others of the Cabinet Ministers suspected of devotion
to the cause of progress and independence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Under these circumstances he was greatly perturbed inasmuch
as he thought that the attitude assumed by the court
not only showed remarkable ingratitude toward this country
which had spent labor and money for Korea, but was also
calculated to thwart the work of internal reform and jeopardize
the independence of the kingdom. The policy pursued
by the court was consequently considered to be injurious to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>Korea, as well as prejudicial in no small degree to the interests
of this country. The accused felt it to be of urgent importance
to apply an effective remedy to this state of affairs,
so as on the one hand to secure the independence of the Korean
kingdom and on the other to maintain the prestige of
this empire in that country. While thoughts like these agitated
his mind, he was secretly approached by the Tă-wŭn-gun
with a request for assistance, the Prince being indignant
at the untoward turn that events were taking and
having determined to undertake the reform of the court and
thus discharge his duty of advising the king. The accused
then held at the legation a conference with Sugimura Fukashi
and Okamoto Ryunosuke on the 3rd of October. The
decision arrived at was that assistance should be rendered to
the Tă-wŭn-gun’s entrance into the palace by making use of
the Japanese drilled Korean soldiers who being hated by the
court felt themselves in danger, and of the young men who
deeply lamented the course of events, and also by causing
the Japanese troops stationed in Seoul to offer their support
to the enterprise. It was further resolved that this opportunity
should be availed of for taking the life of the
queen, who exercised overwhelming influence in the court.
They at the same time thought it necessary to provide against
the possible danger of the Tă-wŭn-gun’s interfering with the
conduct of State affairs in future—an interferance that might
prove of a more evil character than that which it was now
sought to overturn. To this end, a document containing
pledges required of the Ta-wun-gun on four points was
drawn by Sigimura Fukashi. The document was carried to
the country residence of the Ta-wun-gun on the 15th of
the month by Okamoto Ryunosuke, the latter being on intimate
terms with His Highness. After informing the Ta-wun-gun
that the turn of events demanded His Highness’ intervention
once more, Okomoto presented the document to the
Prince saying that it embodied what Minister Miura expected
from him. The Ta-wun-gun, together with his son and grandson
gladly consented to the conditions proposed and also wrote a letter
guaranteeing his good faith. Miura Goro and others decided
to carry out the concerted plan by the middle of the month.
Fearing lest Okamoto’s visit to the Ta-wun-gun’s residence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>should excite suspicion and lead to the exposure of their
plan, it was given out that he had proceeded thither simply
for the purpose of taking leave of the Prince before departing
for home, and to impart an appearance of probability
to this report, it was decided that Okamoto should leave
Seoul for Chemulpo and he took his departure from the
capital on the sixth. On the following day An Kyung-su,
the Minister of War, visited the Japanese Legation
by order of the court. Referring to the projected disbanding
of the Japanese drilled Korean soldiers, he asked the Japanese
Minister’s views on the subject. It was now evident
that the moment had arrived, and that no more delay should
be made. Miura Goro and Sugimura Fukashi consequently
determined to carry out the plot on the night of that very day.
On the one hand, a telegram was sent to Okamoto requesting
him to come back to Seoul at once, and on the other, they
delivered to Horiguchi Kumaichi a paper containing a detailed
program concerning the entry of the Ta-wun-gun into the
palace and caused him to meet Okamoto at Yong-san so that they
might proceed to enter the palace. Miura Goro further issued
instructions to Umayabara Muhon, commander of the Japanese
<a id='corr291.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='batallion'>battalion</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_291.22'>battalion</a></span> in Seoul, ordering him to facilitate the Ta-wun-gun’s
entry into the palace by directing the disposition of the
Japanese drilled Korean troops and by calling out the Imperial
force for their support. Miura also summoned the accused
Adachi <a id='corr291.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Kenszo'>Kenzo</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_291.26'>Kenzo</a></span> and Kunitomo Shigeakira, and requested them
to collect their friends, meeting Okamoto at Yong-san, and
act as the Ta-wun-gun’s body-guard on the occasion of His
Highness’ entrance into the palace. Miura told them that
on the success of the enterprise depended the eradication of
the evils that had done so much mischief to the kingdom for
the past twenty years, and instigated them to dispatch the
Queen when they entered the palace. Miura ordered the
accused Ogiyara Hidejiro to proceed to Yong-san, at the head
of the police force under him, and after consultation with
Okamoto to take such steps as might be necessary to expedite
the Ta-wun-gun’s entry into the palace.</p>

<p><em>THE BRITISH LEGATION.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“The accused, Sugimura Fukashi, summoned Suzuki
Shigemoto and Asayama Kenzo to the Legation and acquainted
them with the projected enterprise, directed the former to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>send the accused, Suzuki Junken, to Yong-san to act as interpreter
and the latter to carry the news to a Korean named Yi
Chu-whe, who was known to be a warm advocate of the Ta-wun-gun’s
return to the palace. Sugimura further drew up
a manifesto, explaining the reasons of the Ta-wun-gun’s
entrance into the palace and charged Ogiwara Hidejiro to
deliver to Horiguchi Kumaichi.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The accused Horiguchi Kumaichi at once departed for
Yong-san on horse-back. Ogiwara Hidejiro issued orders to
the policemen that were off duty to put on civilian dress,
provide themselves with swords and proceed to Yong-san.
Ogiwara also himself went to the same place.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thither also, repaired by his order the accused Watanabe
Takajiro, Oda Yoshimitsu, Nariai Kishiro, Kiwaki Sukunori
and Sakai Masataro.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The accused Yokowo Yutaro joined the party at Yong-san.
Asayama Kenzo saw Yi Chu-whe and informed him of the
projected enterprise against the palace that night. Having
ascertained that Yi had then collected a few other Koreans and
proceeded toward the Ta-wun-gun’s place Asama at once left
for Yong-san. Suzuki Shigemoto went to Yong-san in company
with Suzuki Junken. The accused Adachi Kenzo and
Kunitomo Shigeakira, at the instigation of Miura, decided to
murder the Queen and took steps to collect accomplices.
Twenty-four others (names here inserted) responded to the
call, by Miura’s order, to act as body-guard to the Ta-wun-gun
on the occasion of his entrance into the palace. Hirayama
Iwahiko and more than ten others were directed by Adachi
Kenzo and others to do away with the Queen and they decided
to follow the advice. The others who were not admitted into
the secret but who joined the party from mere curiosity also
carried weapons. With the exception of Kunitomo Shigeakira
Tsukinori and two others all the accused went to Yong-san in
company with Adachi Kenzo.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The accused Okamoto Ryunosuke on receipt of a telegram
saying that time was urgent at once left Chemulpo for
Seoul. Being informed on his way, at about midnight, that
Hoshiguchi Kennaichi was waiting for him at Mapo he
proceeded thither and met the persons assembled there.
There he received from Miura Goro the draft manifesto already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>alluded to, and other documents. After he had consulted
with two or three others about the method of effecting
an entrance into the palace the whole party started for the
Ta-wun-gun’s place with Okamoto as their leader. At about
three o’clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span> on the eighth of October they left the
Prince’s place escorting him in his palanquin, with Yi Chu-whe
and other Koreans. When on the point of departure,
Okamoto assembled the whole party outside the gate of the
Prince’s residence and declared that on entering the palace
the “Fox” should be dealt with according as exigency might
require, the obvious purport of this declaration to instigate
his followers to murder Her Majesty the Queen. As the
result of this declaration, Sakai <a id='corr293.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>Marataro</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_293.13'>Marataro</a></span> and a few others,
who had not yet been initiated into the secret, resolved to
act in accordance with the suggestion. Then slowly proceeding
toward Seoul, the party met the Japanese <a id='corr293.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>drilled</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_293.16'>drilled</a></span> Korean
troops outside the West Gate where they waited some time
for the arrival of the Japanese troops. With the Korean
troops as vanguard the party then proceeded toward the
palace at a more rapid rate. On the way they were joined
by Kunitomo Shigeakira and four others. The accused
Husamoto, Yasumaru and Oura Shigehiko also joined the
party having been requested by Umagabara Muhon to accompany
as interpreters the military officers charged with the
supervision of the Korean troops. About dawn the whole
party entered the palace through the Kwang-wha Gate and at
once proceeded to enter the inner chambers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At this point the recital of the facts abruptly stops and
the court goes on to state that in spite of these proven facts
there is not sufficient evidence to prove that any of the
Japanese actually committed the crime which had been contemplated,
and all the accused are discharged.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is very much to the credit of the Japanese authorities
that they frankly published these incriminating facts and did
not attempt to suppress them. Their action discharging the
accused was a candid statement that in spite of the actual
proof which they adduce it would not be possible to punish
the perpetrators of the outrage, for Miura had been sent as
the accredited Minister of Japan and his acts, <a id='corr293.39'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='through'>though</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_293.39'>though</a></span> unforeseen
by his superiors could not but partake of an official
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>character, and therefore the onus of the affair must fall on
the Japanese Government. This is the effect that was produced
in the public mind, and while the Japanese Government
as such must be acquitted of any intention or desire to
secure the assassination of the Queen, yet it can scarcely
escape the charge of criminal carelessness in according to the
Korean Court a representative who would so far forget the
dignity of his position as to plan and encourage the perpetration
of such a revolting crime.</p>

<p class='c000'>The description of the scene as given by the <a id='corr294.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Hiroshma'>Hiroshima</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_294.10'>Hiroshima</a></span>
court stops abruptly with the entrance into the palace before
the actual business of the day began. It is necessary for us
to take up the narration from that point. The buildings
occupied by the King and Queen were near the back of the
palace enclosure almost half a mile from the front gate, so
that the Japanese and Korean force accompanied by the ex-Regent
had to traverse a long succession of passage-ways
through a great mass of buildings before reaching the object
of their search. Some of the palace guard were met on the
way and easily pushed aside, some of them being killed, among
whom was Col. Hong. When the Japanese arrived at the
buildings occupied by their Majesties a part of them formed
about it in military order guarding all the approaches, but
they did not enter the building. A crowd of Japanese civilians
commonly believed to be <em>soshi</em>, and a considerable number
of Koreans, all heavily armed, rushed into the Royal
quarters. A part of the crowd went into the presence of the King
brandishing their weapons but without directly attacking his
person nor that of the Crown Prince who stood beside him.
Another part of the crowd ranged through the apartments
of the Queen, seizing palace women and demanding information
as to the whereabouts of the Queen. They met Yi Kyŭng-jik
the Minister of the Household before the Queen’s apartments
and at once cut him down, but he managed to crawl into the
presence of the King, where he was despatched by the Japanese.
The Queen was found in one of the rooms which constituted
her suite and was ruthlessly cut down. It is impossible
to state with absolute certainty whether the blow was
struck by a Korean or by a Japanese but the overwhelming
probability is that it was done by one of the armed Japanese</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>The body was wrapped in some sort of blanket, saturated
with petroleum and burned at the edge of a pine grove
immediately to the east of the pond which lies in front of
the royal quarters.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Royal family had been aware for two days of the
danger which threatened. The guards at the palace had
been reduced, the arms had been taken away and the movements
of Japanese troops were very suspicious. The King
advised the Queen to go to a place of safety and she said she
would do so if the Queen Dowager would also go, but the
latter refused. Chong Pyŭng-ha who had been raised to high
office through the patronage of the Queen but who had
struck hands with the Japanese urged with great insistence
that there was no danger to Her Majesty’s person and it was
the confidence expressed by this traitor that did the most to
set at rest the apprehension, of the King and the Queen.</p>

<p class='c000'>During all the time leading up to these events, the
palace guard was in charge of Gen. Dye but his efforts to
carry out the wishes of His Majesty were continually thwarted
and the guard was merely a nominal one.</p>

<p class='c000'>At about the time when the Queen was being killed the
Tă-wŭn-gun came into the presence of the King and took the
direction of affairs at the court. As might be supposed, both
the King and the Crown Prince were in anything but an enviable
frame of mind. They had been pushed about and insulted by low
Japanese and felt that their lives were momentarily in danger.
Col. Yi Kyŭng-jik the Minister of the Household Department
had taken his stand at the door of the Queen’s apartments
and had there been cut down by the Japanese or Koreans
but succeeded in making his way, desperately wounded, into
the presence of the King. He was there stabbed to death by
the Japanese before the eyes of His Majesty. This did not
tend to reassure the King and the Crown Prince but the coming
of the Tă-wŭn-gun tended to quiet them somewhat. Of
course they had no idea as yet that the Queen had been
despatched.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before dawn began to break the King learned that Japanese
troops were pouring into the barracks in front of the
palace, and as some semblance of order had been restored
in the immediate presence of His Majesty, a note was sent in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>haste to the Japanese Minister asking what all this meant.
The messenger found Miura and Sugimura already up and
dressed and sedan chairs at the door. Miura told the messenger
that he had heard that troops had been marched to
the barracks but did not know why. The Minister and his
secretary thereupon proceeded rapidly to the palace. Immediately
upon their arrival all the disturbance suddenly
quieted down and the <em>soshi</em> dispersed and left the palace
grounds. The Japanese Minister and secretary immediately
sought an audience with His Majesty, accompanied only by
an interpreter and another Japanese who had led the <em>soshi</em>.
The Tă-wŭn-gun was also present.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three documents were prepared by those present and
placed before His Majesty for signature, one of them guaranteeing
that the Cabinet should thereafter manage the affairs
of the country, the second appointing Yi Chă-myŭn, the
King’s brother, as Minister of the Household in place of Yi
Kyŭng-jik who had just been killed, and the third appointing
a vice-Minister of the Household. These documents the
king perforce signed. Whereupon all Japanese troops were
removed from the palace and only the Japanese-trained
Korean troops were left as a palace-guard. Later in the day
Ministers of War and Police were appointed in the persons
of Cho Heui-yŭn and Kwŭn Yŭng-jin, both strong partisans
of the Japanese and doubtless privy to the attack upon the
palace and the murder of the Queen. In other words the
King and court was surrounded by men every one of whom
were in sympathy with the movement which had been planned
by Viscount Miura.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very early in the morning, while it was still scarcely daylight,
Mr. Waeber the Russian <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charge d’Affaires</span></em> and Dr.
Allen the American <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charge d’Affaires ad interim</span></em> came to the
palace and sought audience with the King but were told that
the King was unwell and could not see them. They insisted,
however, and succeeded in seeing His Majesty, who told them
that he still had hopes that the Queen had escaped, and besought
their friendly offices to prevent further trouble.
Other foreign representatives were received <a id='corr296.38'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='latter'>later</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_296.38'>later</a></span> in the day.</p>

<p class='c000'>It soon became evident that the Japanese authorities
intended to deny any responsibility for the outrages committed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>Miura stated in his dispatches to his government that the
origin of the <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">emeute</span></em> was a conflict between the Japanese-drilled
Korean troops, who desired to lay a complaint before His
Majesty, and the palace guards who tried to prevent their
entrance into the palace. Miura even sought to strengthen
his disclaimer by obtaining from the newly appointed Minister
of War a definite official statement that the rumors of
his (Miura’s) complicity in the affair were without foundation.
The document that the Minister of War sent in reply
proved altogether too much and defeated its own purpose, for
it stated baldly that there was not a single Japanese in the
palace on the night of the eighth of October, when the Queen
was murdered. As this Minister was a creature of the Japanese
and as the presence of Japanese in the palace was clearly
proved subsequently it is evident that Miura, by this sort of
trickery, only succeeded in further implicating himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the ninth, the day after the <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">emeute</span></em>, a full cabinet was
appointed composed entirely of Japanese sympathisers, but
with one or two exceptions they were not privy to the assassination
of the Queen, though they were willing to profit by
that crime in accepting office at the hands of the perpetrators.
The men appointed were Yi Chă-myŭn, Kim Hong-jip, Kim
Yun-sik, Pak Chöng-yang, Sim Sang-hun, Cho Heui-yŭn, So
Kwang-böm and Chong Pyung-ha.</p>

<p class='c000'>One would have supposed that the enemies of the Queen
would have been satisfied by her death, but not so. On the
eleventh, three days after her assassination, an edict purporting
to have originated with His Majesty and signed by the
full cabinet appeared in the Court Gazette. In it the Queen
is charged with having interfered in public matters, disturbed
the government and put the dynasty in peril. It is stated
that she has disappeared and that her guilt is excessive;
therefore she is deposed from her rank as Queen and reduced
to the level of the lowest class.</p>

<p class='c000'>There can be no doubt that this edict is fraudulent. The
King never gave his consent to it and several of the members
of the Cabinet knew nothing about it, notably Sim Sang-hun
who had already thrown up his position and run away, and
Pak Chöng-yang who denounced the nefarious business and
resigned. It was put through by a few of the Cabinet who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>were thoroughly subservient to the Japanese. The Japanese
Minister in reply to the announcement of the Queen’s degradation,
affected to sympathize with the Korean Government
but thought it was done for the good of the State. The
United States Representative refused to recognize the decree
as coming from His Majesty, and in this he was seconded by
all the the other Foreign Representatives except one.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile the Japanese government began to learn something
of the truth in regard to the Queen’s death and felt
called upon to defend itself from the charge of complicity in
the outrage through its accredited Minister. Consequently
it recalled Miura and Sugimura and upon their arrival in
Japan they were arrested and charged with complicity in the
matter. The fact of their arrest and trial was a distinct disclaimer
on the part of the Japanese government that it was
accessory to the crime; and in spite of the utter inadequacy
of the trial and its almost ludicrous termination we hold to
the theory that the Japanese government was not a party to
the crime excepting in so far as the appointment of such a
man as Miura <a id='corr298.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='ca'>can</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_298.20'>can</a></span> be called complicity.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the vigorous action of Japan in arresting Miura and
putting him on trial had a strong influence upon the course
of events in Korea. The Korean public and all the Foreign
Representatives were demanding that the occurrences of the
eighth of October should be investigated and the responsibility
for the murder of the Queen placed where it rightly belonged.
This itself bore strongly upon the Cabinet, but when
in addition to this the Japanese government itself seemed to
be weakening and it appeared that Miura’s acts would prove
to have been unauthorized things begun to look rather black
for the men who were enjoying office solely through Miura’s
influence, and although the fiction was still maintained that the
Queen was not dead but in hiding somewhere, the situation
became more and more strained until at last it became evident
even to the Cabinet that something must be done to relieve
the situation. Accordingly on the 26th of November
the Foreign Representatives and several other foreigners
were invited to the palace and it was announced in
the presence of His Majesty that Cho Heui-yŭn the Minister
of War and Kwŭn Yŭng-jin the Chief of Police were dismissed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>that the edict degrading the Queen was rescinded and
that the facts connected with the attack on the palace would
be investigated by the Department of Justice and all guilty
persons tried and punished. At the same time the death of
Her Majesty was formally announced.</p>

<p class='c000'>The popular feeling against the Japanese-trained troops
was so strong that they were dismissed and another guard
summoned, but as a matter of fact this new guard was composed
almost entirely of the very men who had formerly composed
the Japanese-drilled corps.</p>

<p class='c000'>The position of His Majesty during the months succeeding
the attack was anything but comfortable. He had no
voice in the direction of affairs, and he considered himself
practically a prisoner in the hands of the Cabinet. He even
feared for his life, and for weeks ate no food except what was
brought to him in a locked box from friends outside the
palace. He had requested that two or three foreigners should
come to the palace each night and be at hand in case of trouble,
feeling that their presence would exert a deterrent influence
upon any who might plot injury to his person.</p>

<p class='c000'>The half-way measures adopted on Nov. 26th by no
means satisfied those who wished to see His Majesty freed
from practical durance at the hands of men thoroughly obnoxious
to him, and a scheme was evolved by a number of
Koreans to effect his release by forcible means. The purpose
of these men was a laudable one but the execution of it was
ill-managed. On the night of the 28th upwards of a thousand
Koreans demanded entrance into the palace. They had arranged
with one of the members of the palace guard, inside,
to open the gate to them, but at the last moment he failed
them and they found themselves balked. The palace was in
some confusion, the King had called in to his presence the
three foreigners who, at his request, were on duty that night,
but in spite of their assurances that his person would be protected
it was only natural that excitement should run high.
The crowd without were shouting wildly and attempting to
scale the high wall, and the members of the cabinet, before
the King, did not know at what moment the guard might
betray them to the assailants, and they knew that once betrayed
they would be torn to pieces without mercy. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>tried therefore to induce the King to remove to a distant part
of the palace where he could hide for a long time before he
could be found even though the crowd should effect an
entrance. The night was bitterly cold and the King was
but lightly clad, and as the King’s person was safe in any
event, the foreigners who were with him opposed the move
strongly and at last were compelled to use physical force to
prevent the change, which would certainly have endangered
the King’s life. The purpose of the cabinet was thus thwarted
but as the hours passed it become evident that the men
outside would not be able to effect an entrance. The shouts
gradually died away and at last the crowd dispersed leaving
in the hands of the palace guard three or four men who had
scaled the wall but had not been followed by their confreres.</p>

<p class='c000'>In view of the attitude of the Tokyo Government the
Japanese in Seoul were now entirely <a id='corr300.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='quescent'>quiescent</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_300.16'>quiescent</a></span> and the government
was standing on its own base. The cabinet held its
own by virtue of the palace guard which was composed of the
soldiers trained by the Japanese. This cabinet and guard
held together from necessity, for both knew that should their
power fail they would be denounced as traitors and under
the circumstances could expect little help from the Japanese.
The cabinet had to make a show of investigating the attack
of Oct. 5th and someone must be killed for having murdered
the queen. At the same time punishment was to be meted out
to the principals in the attempt on the palace on November
28th.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three men were arrested and charged with being
directly implicated in the crime of regicide. Of these one
was certainly innocent and while the second was probably
privy to the crime, being a lieutenant of the Japanese-trained
troops, there was no evidence adduced to prove his actual
participation in the act of assassination. He had not been
reinstated in his position in the new guard and he knew
altogether too much about the existing cabinet. Their
choice fell upon him as one of the scapegoats. The third
was Yi Chu-hoé formerly Vice Minister of War. There was
no evidence adduced against him at the trial, though from
other considerations he seems to have been implicated in the
outrage. He was chosen as the principal one to bear the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>obloquy of the crime, probably because (1) he was a bitter
enemy of the existing cabinet and (2) because it was necessary
for the sake of appearances to convict and execute someone
of rank and reputation. As a fact the court did not
know and never discovered who the actual perpetrators were.
The three men were executed before the end of the year.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though only three men were arrested in connection
with the assassination of the queen thirty-three men were
arrested in connection with the comparatively trivial affair
of November 28th. Their trial proceeded simultaneously
with that of the other three. Two of them were condemned
to death, four to exile for life and four to three years imprisonment.
To show the kind of evidence on which these convictions
were based we will cite the case of Prince Yi Chă-sun
who was proved to have gotten hold of some compromising
documents and to have shown them to the King only, instead
of to <em>the proper authorities</em>, namely, of course, the cabinet.
On these grounds he was sentenced to three years imprisonment!</p>

<p class='c000'>December and January saw matters move to an inevitable
climax. The cabinet forced upon the people the edict
ordering the cutting off of the top-knot, the distinctive mark
of Korean citizenship. The whole country was in a ferment
and the people, almost to a man, were gnashing their teeth
at the cabinet. The finding of the Hiroshima court claimed
to have freed Miura and his fellows from blame and it was
rumored that several of them were to return to Korea to take
office under the government. Chöng Pyung-ha, a proved
traitor, had been reinstated in the cabinet as Minister of Agriculture
and Cho Heui-yŭn as Minister of War, and it was
reported that Kwŭn Yŭng-jin who had fled to Japan would
be made again Chief of Police. It was perfectly evident,
therefore, that the grip of the Japanese upon the king
through the <a id='corr301.33'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Goaler'>Gaoler</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_301.33'>Gaoler</a></span> Cabinet was tightening and that there
was no escape from it except through heroic measures.
These measures the king was prepared to adopt rather than
longer endure the humiliating position to which he seemed
condemned. At that time the principal men in the cabinet
were Kim Hong-jip, Chöng Pyŭng-ha, O Yun-jung, Yu Kil-jun.
Of these O Yun-jung seems to have been far less culpable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>than the rest. The king had great confidence in him
and had he not met his fate at the hands of the people he
would probably have been called back to office.</p>

<p class='c000'>But now we come to the important step taken by His
Majesty to free himself from his unpleasant position. He
determined to find asylum in the Russian Legation. C.
Waeber was the Russian Minister, a pronounced friend of the
dead Queen, and a man of great ability. Just how he was approached
and his consent gained to the king’s scheme is
not generally known but in view of subsequent events and
the part that Russia intended to play in Korea it is easy to
see how the Russian Representative would welcome an opportunity
to do the King such a signal service and one which
was of such a personal character as to render it certain that
it would never be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c000'>The plan was carried out successfully in every detail.
Women’s chairs were caused to be sent in and out the palace
gates at frequent intervals by day and night until the guards
had become quite accustomed to them. Then on the night
of the eleventh of February the King and the Crown Prince
without escort slipped by the guards in common women’s
chairs and were taken directly to the Russian Legation
where they were courteously received and given the best
portion of the Legation building. This act was of course a
grievous lapse from the dignity that befits a king but under
the circumstances there is much to say by way of excuse.
On the whole it must be considered a mistake so far as the
country at large is concerned, for it set in motion a new set
of factors which probably did more harm than the temporary
enforced seclusion of the King could have done. It acted as a
potent factor in embittering the Japanese against Russia and
opened the door for Russian intrigue which finally hastened
if it did not actually cause the war at present waging. Had
Japan been able to preserve the predominance which she
held in Korea just after the China-Japan war she might have
looked with more or less complaisancy upon the Russian
aggression in Manchuria, but when Korea itself became disputed
ground the war was inevitable.</p>

<p class='c000'>At seven o’clock on the morning of February 11th the
King and the Crown Prince entered the Russian Legation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>Several hours elapsed before the Cabinet in the palace became
aware of the fact. During that interval active operations
were going on at the Russian Legation. The organization
of a new cabinet was hastened by summoning from various
parts of the city such officials as the King could trust. Pak
Chöng-yang was made Prime Minister. No time was lost in
putting out a Royal Edict deprecating the necessity of taking
refuge in a foreign legation, promising to punish the real
authors of the Queen’s assassination, rescinding the order for
cutting the top-knots. This was posted on the gates of the
Legation and at various points throughout the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the public awoke to the momentous fact, a thrill
of excitement and, generally, of approval went through the
whole population of Seoul. The city hummed with excited
humanity. The streets swarmed with the crowds bent upon
watching the course of such stirring events.</p>

<p class='c000'>Later in the day the King put forth an edict calling upon
the soldiers to rally to his support and urging them to bring
the heads of the traitors Cho Heui-yŭn, U Pöm-sŭn, Yi Tu-whang,
Yi Pom-nă, Yi Chin-ho and Kon Yong-jin. But later
still this was toned down to read that these individuals
should be seized and turned over to the proper authorities for
trial.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reason why the names of Kim Hong-jip, Chöng
Pyŭng-Ha and others of the former cabinet were not included
was because they had already met their fate. As soon as it
became known in the palace that the King had fled, these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>men saw that their lives were forfeited. O Yun-jung managed
to escape to the country but was set upon and killed by the
people, Cho Heui-Yŭn escaped, Yu Kil-jun was spirited away
to Japan by the Japanese; but Kim Hong-jip and Chöng
Pyŭng-ha found no way of escape. Being seized by the
Korean soldiers, were immediately rushed by the crowd and
killed. Their bodies were hauled to Chong-no where they
were stamped upon, kicked, bitten and stoned by a half-crazed
rabble for hours. A Japanese who happened to be
passing was set upon by the crowd and killed and several
foreigners drawn to the spot by curiosity were threatened.</p>

<p class='c000'>The King was shocked when he heard of the summary
execution of the two ministers, whom he intended to give a
fair trial. Two days later an edict was promulgated by the
King deploring the impoverished state of the country and
laying the blame upon himself; and concluded by remitting
all arrears of taxes due up to July 1894. The new
cabinet consisted of the following men Pak Chöng-yang, Yi
Yun-yong, An Kyŭng-su, Ko Yong-heui, Yun Chi-ho, Yun
Yong-gu, Yi Wan-yong and Cho Pyŭng-jik.</p>

<p class='c000'>To say that the Japanese were nonplussed by this <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</span></em>
on the part of the King would be to put it very mildly. All
their efforts to consolidate their power in Korea and to secure
there some fruit of the victory in the war just finished, had
been worse than thrown away. The King had thrown himself
into the arms of Russia and the whole Korean people
were worked up to a white heat against Japan, comparable
only with the feelings elicited by the invasion of 1592. It
was a very great pity, for Japan was in a position to do for
Korea infinitely more than Russia would do. The interests
of Korea and Japan were identical or at least complementary
and the mistake which Japan made in the latter half of 1895
was one whose effects will require decades to efface.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the King thus wrenched himself out of Japanese
hands the Japanese papers in Seoul bewailed the fact that
the country was without a ruler, and almost directly advised
the people to put someone else on the throne, and this without
censure from the Japanese authorities. And it is well
known among Koreans that there was a strong faction among
the Koreans who were willing to attempt to put Yi Chun-yong,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>the grandson of the Tă-wŭn-gun on the throne, had
that ambitious young man been possessed of the requisite
amount of assurance. Fortunately such was not the case
and the country was saved from further upheaval.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Japanese authorities though thrown into consternation
by this radical movement of His Majesty did not
give up hope of mending matters. The Japanese Minister
saw the King at the Russian Legation and urged upon him
every possible argument for returning to the palace. His
Majesty, however, being now wholly relieved from anxiety
as to his personal safety, enjoyed the respite too <a id='corr305.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='thorougly'>thoroughly</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_305.11'>thoroughly</a></span> to
cut it short, and so politely refused to change his place of
residence. A large number of Japanese in Seoul became
convinced that Japan had hopelessly compromised herself,
and left the country, but the Japanese Government itself by
no act or word granted that her paramount influence in the
peninsula was impaired and with admirable <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</span></em> took
up the new line of work imposed upon her by the King’s
peculiar action, meanwhile putting down one more score
against Russia, to be reckoned with later.</p>

<p class='c000'>The country was suffering from the excitement caused
by the news of the Japanese diplomatic reverses, and the
people in many districts rose in revolt and declared that they
would drive all the Japanese out of the country. These
efforts were however scattered and sporadic in their nature
and were successfully quelled by Korean Government troops
sent down to the various disaffected districts for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now that it was possible the King hastened to order a
new investigation of the circumstances attending the death
of the Queen. It was feared that this would result in a very
sweeping arrest of Koreans and the punishment of many people
on mere suspicion, but these fears were ill-founded. The
trials were carried through under the eye of Mr. Greathouse
the adviser to the Law Department and a man of great legal
ability. Thirteen men were arrested and tried in open court
without torture and with every privilege of a fair trial. One
man Yi Whi-wha was condemned to death, four banished for
life and five for lesser periods. This dispassionate trial was
not the least of the signs which pointed toward a new and
enlightened era in Korean political history.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>Not only in the country but in Seoul as well the prestige
of Japan had suffered greatly by the events of the winter of
1895-96. After the Japan-China war the Koreans were
divided into two distinct factions, one holding strongly with
the Japanese and the other advocating a more conservative
policy, but gradually as the political situation began to
crystalize these two split into four, namely the Japanese
faction, the King’s faction, the Queen’s faction, and the Tă-wŭn-gun’s
faction. This is merely another way of saying
that every strong political possibility will have its own faction
in such a land as this, according as each man fancies
that his champion will get supreme power and reward those
who have followed in his train. The number of men who
follow the standard of this or that party because of any altruistic
or purely patriotic consideration is so small as to be
a <a id='corr306.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>negligeable</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_306.16'>negligeable</a></span> quantity. When, therefore, it appeared that
Japan’s star was setting in Korea there was a hasty shifting
of political platforms and soon it appeared that there were
only two, one of which favored Russian influence and the
other conservative and very quiet, for the time being, until
the extreme pro-Russian enthusiasm should subside somewhat.
Of course the Tă-wŭn-gun’s had disappeared with the waning
fortunes of the Japanese and the Queen’s faction had
gone over to the Russians. It was the conservatives alone
that held to their former position and desired no foreign interferance
whatever. But many of those who had favored the Japanese
joined the conservative party but unlike the “moss-back”
conservatives wanted to do something actively to counteract
Russian influence. They therefore worked to bring
English and American influence into greater prominence. In
the heart of this movement was born the “Independence Club.”
It will be remembered that ever since the previous year
Dr. Philip Jaisohn had been acting as adviser to the Privy
Council. This council enjoyed considerable power at first
but gradually fell to a secondary place, but now that new
conditions had sprung up the element combatting the Russian
influence took advantage of the presence of Dr. Jaisohn
and other Koreans who had been educated abroad. The
Russians seemed to look with complaisance upon this movement
and in the Spring of this year seem to have made no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>effort to prevent the appointment of J. McLeavy Brown,
L.L.D., as Adviser to the Finance Department, with large
powers; which seemed to bear out the belief that the Russian
Minister was sincere in his statement that Russia wished the
King to be quite untrammelled in the administration of his
government. It is this generous policy of Mr. Waeber that
is believed to have caused his transfer later to another post,
to be replaced by A. de Speyer who adopted a very different
policy. However this may have been, things began to take
on a very hopeful aspect in Seoul. Needed reforms were
carried through; torture was abolished in the Seoul courts,
a concession was given to an American company to construct
a railway between Seoul and Chemulpo, Min Yong-whan
was appointed special envoy to the coronation of the Czar, work
was begun on the American mining concession granted the
year before, various schools were founded, and the outlook
on the whole was very bright indeed. It looked as if a
solution had been found for the difficulties that afflicted the
state and that an era of comparatively enlightened government
was opening.</p>

<p class='c000'>For some time there had existed a more or less secret organization
among the Koreans, the single article of whose
political creed was Independence both from China and Japan,
or in other words Korea for Koreans. Now that the King had
been relieved of Chinese suzerainty by the Japanese and of
Japanese restraint by himself, this little society under the
leadership of Dr. Philip Jaisohn blossomed out into what was
called <em>The Independence Club</em>. The name but partially described
the society, for while it advocated the complete independence
of Korea it still more insistently advocated a liberal
government, in the shape of a genuine constitutional monarchy
in which the royal prerogative should be largely curtailed
and the element of paternalism eliminated. At first the
greater stress was laid upon the general principle of Korean
<a id='corr307.35'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Indepenence'>Independence</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_307.35'>Independence</a></span> and to this the King in the joy of his newly
found freedom heartily agreed. The royal sanction was given
to the Independence Club and it was launched upon a voyage
which had no haven, but ended in total shipwreck. This club,
society was composed of young men many of whom were doubtless
aroused for the time being to something like patriotic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>fervor but who had had no practical experience of the rocky
road of Korean politics or of the obstacles which would be encountered.
The cordiality of the King’s recognition blinded
them to the fact that the real object of their organization,
namely the definition of the royal prerogative, was one
that must eventually arouse first the suspicion and then the
open hostility of His Majesty and would become the slogan of
all that army of self-seekers who saw no chance for self-aggrandisement
except in the immemorial spoils system. These
young men were armed with nothing but a laudable enthusiasm.
They could command neither the aid of the Korean
army nor the advocacy of the older statesmen, all of whom
were either directly hostile to the movement or had learned
caution through connection with previous abortive attempts to
stem the tide of official corruption. The purpose of this club, so
far as it knew its own mind, was a laudable one in theory but
the amount of persistency, courage, tact and self-restraint
necessary to carry the plan to a successful issue was so immensely
greater than they could possibly guess, that, considering
the youth and inexperience of the personnel of the
society, the attempt was doomed to failure. They never clearly
formulated a constructive plan by which to build upon the
ruins of that system which they were bent upon destroying.
Even had they cleared the way to such construction they
could not have found a statesman in Korea of recognized
standing and prestige, to act as master-builder, whose previous
record would have made him acceptable to themselves or a fit
exponent of their principles.</p>

<p class='c000'>On April 7th the first foreign newspaper was founded
by Dr. Philip Jaisohn. It was called <cite>The Independent</cite> and was
partly in the native character. From the first it exerted a
powerful influence among the Koreans and was one of the main
factors which led to the formation of the Independence Club.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both Japan and Russia were desirous of coming to an
understanding as to Korea and on May 14th there was published
the Waeber-Komura Agreement which was modified
and ratified later under the name of the Lobanoff-Yamata
Agreement. According to the terms of this convention both
Powers guaranteed to respect the independence of Korea and
not to send soldiers into the country except by common consent.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>The summer of 1896 saw great material improvements in
Seoul. The work of clearing out and widening the streets
was vigorously pushed and although much of the work was
done superficially some permanent improvement was effected,
and the “squatters” along the main streets were cleaned
out, it is hoped for all time. In July the concession for
building a railway between Seoul and Wiju was given to a
French syndicate. From subsequent events it appears that
there was no fixed determination on the part of the French
to push this great engineering work to a finish but merely to
preempt the ground and prevent others from doing it.
Russian influence doubtless accomplished this, and
from that time there began to spring up the idea that Korea
would be divided into two spheres of influence, the Japanese
predominant in the south and the Russians in the north.</p>

<p class='c000'>In spite of the favorable signs that appeared during the
early months of 1896 and the hopes which were entertained
that an era of genuine reform had been entered upon, the
coming of summer began to reveal the hollowness of such
hopes. The King himself was strongly conservative and
never looked with favor upon administrative changes which
tended to weaken his personal hold upon the finances of the
country and he chafed under the new order of things. In
this he was encouraged by many of the leading officials, who
saw in the establishment of liberal institutions the end of
their opportunities for personal power and aggrandisement.
The old order of things appealed to them too strongly and it
became evident that the government was rapidly lapsing into
its former condition of arbitrary and partisan control. Open
and violent opposition to such harmless innovations as the
wearing of foreign uniforms by the students of Foreign
Language Schools indicated too plainly the tendency of the
time and the Russian authorities did nothing to influence His
Majesty in the right direction. Judging from subsequent
events it was not Russia’s policy to see an enlightened administration
in Seoul. The political plans of that Power
could be better advanced by a return to the <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">status ante quo</span></em>.
The act of the government in substituting an Independence
Arch in place of the former gate, outside the West Gate,
which commemorated Chinese suzerainty, was looked upon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>and rightly, by the more thoughtful as being merely a superficial
demonstration which was based upon no deeper desire
than that of being free from all control or restraint except
such as personal inclination should dictate. The current was
setting toward a concentration of power rather than toward
a healthful distribution of it, and thus those who had hailed
the vision of a new and rejuvenated state were compelled to
confess that it was but a mirage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pressure was brought to bear upon the court to remove
from the Russian Legation, and it was high time that such a
move be made. As a matter of urgent necessity it was considered
a not too great sacrifice of dignity to go to the Legation
but to make it a permanent residence was out of the
question. The King was determined however, not to go back
to the palace from which he had fled. It held too many gruesome
memories. It was decided to build the Myŭng-ye
Palace in the midst of the Foreign Quarter with Legations
on three sides of it. The site selected was the same as that
which King Sŭn-jo used in 1593 when he returned from his
flight to the north before the armies of Hideyoshi. He had
lived here for some fourteen years while the Chang-dok
Palace was building. The present King however intended
it as a permanent residence, and building operations were begun
on a large scale, but it was not until February of the following
year that His Majesty finally removed from the
Russian Legation to his new palace.</p>

<p class='c000'>All during the latter half of 1896 the gulf between the
Independence party and the conservatives kept widening.
The latter grew more and more confident and the former
more and more determined. Dr. Jaisohn in his capacity of
adviser to the Council of State was blunt and outspoken in
his advice to His Majesty and it was apparent that the latter
listened with growing impatience to suggestions which, however
excellent in themselves, found no response in his own
inclinations. The Minister of Education voiced the growing
sentiment of the retrogressive faction in a book called “The
Warp and Woof of Confucianism” in which such extreme
statements were made that several of the Foreign Representatives
felt obliged to interfere and call him to account. A
Chief of Police was appointed who was violently anti-reform.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>The assassin of Kim Ok-kyun was given an important position
under the government. A man who had attempted the
life of Pak Yong-hyo was made Minister of Law, and on all
sides were heard contemptuous comments upon the “reform
nonsense” of the liberal faction. And yet in spite of this the
momentum of the reform movement though somewhat retarded
had by no means been completely stopped. The Summer
and Autumn of this year 1896 saw the promulgation of a
large number of edicts of a salutary nature, relating to the
more systematic collection of the national revenues, the reorganization
of gubernatorial and prefectural systems, the
definition of the powers and privileges of provincial officials,
the further regulation of the postal system, the definition of
the powers of the superintendents of trade in the open ports,
the abolition of illegal taxation and the establishment of
courts of law in the various provinces and in the open ports.
As many of these reforms survived the collapse of the liberal
party they must be set down as definite results which justify
the existence of that party and make its overthrow a matter
of keen regret to those who have at heart the best interests
of the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>All this time Russian interests had been cared for
sedulously. The king remained in close touch with the
Legation and Col. Potiata and three other Russian officers
were put in charge of the Palace Guard, while Kim Hong-nyuk,
the erstwhile water-carrier, continued to absorb the
good things in the gift of His Majesty. And yet the Russians
with all their power did not attempt to obstruct the
plans of the subjects of other Powers in Korea. Mr. Stripling,
a British subject, was made adviser to the Police Department,
a mining concession was granted to a German syndicate;
an American was put in charge of a Normal School,
Dr. Brown continued to direct the work of the Finance Department
and the work on the Seoul Chemulpo Railway was
pushed vigorously by an American syndicate. The Russians
held in their hands the power to put a stop to much of this,
but they appeared to be satisfied with holding the power
without exercising it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first half of 1897 was characterized by three special
features in Korea. The first was a continuance of so-called
reforms, all of which were of a utilitarian character.
A gold mine concession was given to a German syndicate, a
Chinese Language School and other schools were founded
and the difficult work of cleaning out the Peking Pass was
completed. It was announced that Chinnampo and Mokpo
would be opened to trade in the Autumn. The second
feature was the steady growth of the conservative element
which was eventually to resume complete control of the
government. As early as May of this year the editor of the
<cite>Korean Repository</cite> said with truth “The collapse is as complete
as it is pathetic. After the King came to the Russian
Legation the rush of the reform movement could not be
stayed at once nor even deflected. But soon there came the
inevitable reaction. Reforms came to be spoken of less and
less frequently. There was a decided movement backwards
toward the old, well-beaten paths. But it was impossible to
reestablish the old order of things entirely. We come then
to the period of the revision of laws. Shortly after the King
removed to the new palace an edict was put forth ordering
the appointment of a Commission for the Revision of the
Laws. This was received with satisfaction by the friends of
progress. This commission contained the names of many
prominent men such as Kim Pyung-si, Pak Chöng-yang and
Yi Wan-yong as well as the names of Dr. Brown, General
Greathouse, Mr. Legendre and Dr. Jaisohn.” But by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>twelfth of April the whole thing was dropped and the strong
hopes of the friends of Korea were again dashed to the
ground. The third feature of this period is the growing
importance of Russian influence in Seoul. The training of
the Korean army had already been taken out of Japanese
hands and given to Russians and in August thirteen more
Russian military instructors were imported. It was plain
that Russia meant to carry out an active policy in Korea.
Russian admirals, <a id='corr313.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='including,'>including</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_313.9'>including</a></span> Admiral Alexeieff, made frequent
visits to Seoul, and at last Russia made public avowal
of her purposes, when she removed Mr. Waeber, who had
served her so long and faithfully here and sent Mr. A. de
Speyer to take his place. There was an immediate and
ominous change in the tone which Russia assumed. From
the very first de Speyer showed plainly that he was sent here
to impart a new vigor to Russo-Korean relations; that things
had been going too slow. It is probable that complaints had
been made because in spite of Russia’s predominating influence
at the Korean Court concessions were being given to Americans,
Germans and others outside. De Speyer soon showed the
color of his instructions and began a course of brow-beating,
the futility of which must have surprised him. It was on
September 7th that he arrived, and within a month he had
begun operations so actively that he attracted the attention
of the world. In the first place he demanded a coaling
station at Fusan on Deer Island which commands the
entrance to the harbor. This was a blow aimed directly at
Japan and sure to be resented. It came to nothing. Then
Mr. Kir Alexeieff arrived from Russia, an agent of the
Finance Department in St. Petersburg. In the face of the
fact that Dr. Brown was Chief Commissioner of Custom and
Adviser to the Finance Department, Mr. Alexeieff was appointed
by the Foreign Office as director of the Finance
Department. But the policy of bluff which de Speyer had
inaugurated was not a success; he carried it so far that he
aroused the strong opposition of other Powers, notably England,
and before the end of the year, after only three months
of incumbency, de Speyer was called away from Seoul. As
we shall see, the whole of his work was overthrown in the
following Spring.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>But we must retrace our steps a little and record some
other interesting events that happened during the closing
months of 1897. It was on October 17th that the King went
to the Imperial Altar and there was crowned Emperor of Tai-han.
This had been some time in contemplation and as
Korea was free from foreign suzerainty she hastened, while
it was time, to declare herself an empire. This step was
recognized by the treaty powers within a short period and
so Korea took her place on an equality with China and
Japan.</p>

<p class='c000'>On November 21st the funeral ceremony of the late
Queen was held. It was a most imposing pageant. The
funeral procession passed at night out of the city to the tomb
where elaborate preparations had been made, and a large number
of foreigners assembled there to witness the obsequies.</p>

<p class='c000'>The situation in Korea as the year 1898 opened was
something as follows. The conservatives had things well
in hand and the Independence Club was passing on to its
final effort and its final defeat. The work of such men as
Dr. Jaisohn was still tolerated but the King and the most influential
officials chafed under the wholesome advice that
they received and it was evident that the first pretext would
be eagerly seized for terminating a situation that was getting
very awkward for both sides. The reaction was illustrated
in an attack on the <cite>Independent</cite> by which the Korean postal
department refused to carry it in the mails. The Russians
had taken the bull by the horns and were finding that they
had undertaken more than they could carry through without
danger of serious complications. The Russian government
saw this and recalled de Speyer in time to preserve much of
their influence in Seoul. The Emperor, being now in his
own palace but with easy access to the Russian Legation,
seems to have lent his voice to the checking of the reform
propaganda and in this he was heartily seconded by his leading
officials. The most promising aspect of the situation was
the determined attitude of the British government relative to
the enforced retirement of Dr. Brown. When it became evident
that a scarcely concealed plan was on foot to oust British
and other foreigners in Korea, Great Britain by a single word
and by a concentration of war vessels at Chemulpo changed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>the whole program of the Russians; but as it appeared later
the Russian plans were <em>only</em> changed, not abandoned. So the
year opened with things political in a very unsettled state.
Everything was in transition. The Independents and the
Russians had some idea of what they wanted but seemed to
be at sea as to the means for accomplishing it. The conservatives
alone sat still and held on, sure that in the long run
they would triumph even if they could not stop the march of
material progress in the cleaning of the streets and the building
of railways.</p>

<p class='c000'>February of 1898 saw the taking off of the most commanding
figure in Korean public life during the nineteenth
century, in the person of Prince Tă-wŭn the father of the <a id='corr315.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Emperpor'>Emperor</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_315.13'>Emperor</a></span>,
formerly Regent. For almost forty years he had been
more or less intimately connected with the <a id='corr315.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='stiring'>stirring</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_315.15'>stirring</a></span> events which
have marked the present reign. The things which specially
marked his career are (1) the Roman Catholic persecution of
1866, (2) the determined opposition to the opening of the
country to foreign intercourse, (3) the building of the Kyöng-bok
Palace, (4) the debasing of Korean currency, (5) the feud
with the Queen’s party, (6) the temporary exile in China, (7)
the assassination of the Queen. Whatever may be said for or
against the Prince because of his policy he remains in the
minds of the people a strong, independent character, and
they cannot fail to admire the man even though they have to
condemn his policy. His adherents stood by him with splendid
loyalty even in the hours of his disgrace, because he was in
some sense really great.</p>

<p class='c000'>This time was characterized by curious inconsistencies.
At the same time that an edict was promulgated stating that
no more concessions would be granted to foreigners the Seoul
Electric Company was organized to construct a tramway and
a lighting plant in Seoul. Material improvements continued
parallel with, but in the opposite direction from, the policy of
the Government. An agreement was even entered into with
an American firm for the construction of a system of water
works for Seoul at a cost of some seven million yen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The failing hopes of the Independence Club drove it to
its final place, that of protest. Memorials began to pour in
protesting against this and that. In February it complained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>of foreign control in Korea, directing the attack apparently
upon the Russian pretentions: but if so it was unnecessary,
for by the first of March the Russians decided that their position
was untenable or that a temporary withdrawal of pressure
from Seoul would facilitate operations in other directions, and
so, under cover of a complaint as to the vacillating policy of
the Korean Government they proposed to remove Mr. Alexeieff
from his uncomfortable position vis-a-vis Dr. Brown and
also take away all the military instructors. Perhaps they
were under the impression that this startling proposal would
frighten the Government into making protestations that would
increase Russian influence here, but if so they were disappointed
for the Government promptly accepted their proposition
and dispensed with the services of these men. No
doubt the Government had come to look with some anxiety
upon the growing influence of Russia here and with the same
oscillatory motion as of yore made a strong move in the opposite
direction when the opportunity came. The Korean
Government has been nearly as astute as Turkey in playing
off her “friends” against each other.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just one month later April 12th N. Matunine relieved
Mr. de Speyer, the Russo-Korean bank closed its doors, the Russian
military and other officers took their departure and a very
strained situation was relieved for the time being. At about
the same time Dr. Jaisohn was paid off and left the country,
the management of the <cite>Independent</cite> falling into other hands.
This event was important as strowing the hopeless state into
which the Independence Club and all other friends of progress
had fallen. From this time on the tone of the club grew
steadily more petulant. The older men in it who saw that
the time was not ripe for reform withdrew and left the management
of the club and the determination of its policy in
the hands of younger men who had not the experience necessary
for the handling of such affairs; and although in Yun-Chi-ho,
the president of the Club, it had a clear-headed and
devoted man he was not able to control the young blood that
had begun to run with something too feverish a course in
the veins of the society. The excited state of the public
mind is proved by the fact that several other daily and weekly
periodicals sprang up, debating societies flourished and people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>began to talk about things. The conservations laid all these
things up against the Independence Club and awaited their
time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The summer of this year furnished Seoul with some excitement
in the shape of a discovered conspiracy to force the
King to abdicate, place the Crown Prince on the throne and
institute a new era in Korean history. The plot, if such it
may be called, was badly planned and deservedly fell through.
It was one of the foolish moves called out by the excitement
engendered in the Independence movement. An Kyŭng su,
ex-president of the Independence Club, was the party mainly
implicated and he saved himself only by promptly decamping
and putting himself into the hands of the Japanese.</p>

<p class='c000'>About the same time the Independence Club came into
direct opposition to the Government in its strong protest against
the appointment of the conservative Cho Pyŭng-sik to the
vice-presidency of the Council of State. The commotion, engendered
by this, resulted in Mr. Yun Chi-ho being called before
the Emperor, where he made a strong appeal in favor of
the Independence Club and asserted the continued loyalty of
the club toward His Majesty. Unfortunately he asserted that
the Emperor having sanctioned the founding of the club could
disband it merely by Imperial decree. For the time, this appeal
sufficed and the immediate object of the society was secured,
but the Emperor did not forget that he had it in his
power to dissolve the club by a single word. As a fact, the
mere sanction of the founding of the Club gave no more power
to dissolve it than the wedding ceremony which a clergyman
performs gives the right in future to dissolve that union.
There can be no doubt that from this time on the Emperor
was determined to eliminate this disturbing element at the
first opportunity. He had no sympathy with its platform,
one plank of which was the curtailment of the Imperial
prerogative.</p>

<p class='c000'>August saw the fall of Kim Hong-nyuk, the former Russian
interpreter, who ruffled it so proudly at Court on account
of his connection with the Russian Legation. For a year he
had a good time of it and amassed great wealth, but when
the Russians withdrew their influence in March of this year
Kim lost all his backing and thenceforward his doom was as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>sure as fate itself. The genuine noblemen whose honors he
had filched were on his track and in August he was accused,
deposed and banished. This did not satisfy his enemies however,
but an opportunity came when on September tenth an
attempt was made to <a id='corr318.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='posion'>poison</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_318.5'>poison</a></span> the Emperor and the Crown
Prince. The attempt came near succeeding and in the investigation
which followed one of the scullions deposed that
he had been instructed by a friend of Kim Hong-nyuk to
put something into the coffee. How Kim, away in banishment,
could have had anything to do with it would be hard
to tell. He may have conceived the plan but the verdict of a
calm and dispassionate mind must be that he probably knew
nothing about it at all. However, in such a case, someone
must suffer. The criminal <em>must</em> be found; and it is more than
probable that those who hated Kim Hong-nyuk thought he
would make an excellent scape-goat. He was tried, condemned
and executed.</p>

<p class='c000'>About the same time the Emperor came to the conclusion
that he would like to have a foreign body-guard. C. R.
Greathouse was sent to Shanghai to find the material for this
guard. Thirty men were picked up, of various nationalities,
and they arrived in Seoul on September fifteenth. This
move caused intense excitement and opposition. The Independence
Club was in the fore-front of the protest that was
made. A dozen good arguments were adduced showing why
this should not <a id='corr318.26a'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='be be'>be</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_318.26a'>be</a></span> done, and so <a id='corr318.26b'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='unaminous'>unanimous</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_318.26b'>unanimous</a></span> was the sentiment
that the Emperor yielded to popular clamor and dismissed
the men, but this, again, cannot but have set the Emperor
against the Independence Club, inasmuch as they had
been principally instrumental in thwarting a pet scheme of
his own.</p>

<p class='c000'>The month of September witnessed better things than
these, however. The Japanese obtained their concession for
the Seoul-Fusan Railway, an event of great importance <a id='corr318.34'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='word missing'>in</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_318.34'>in</a></span> every
way and one that will mean much to Korea.</p>

<p class='c000'>In September the Independence Club determined that it
would be well to put forward a program of work in place of
the merely destructive criticism which had for some time
characterized its policy. An appeal was made to the general
public to assemble, in order to suggest reforms. Whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>this was wise or not is a question. A popular assembly in
Korea is hardly capable of coming to wise conclusions or to
participate in plans for constructive statesmanship. In addition
to this an appeal to the people was inevitably construed
by the conservatives as a desperate measure which invited
revolution. In a sense they were <a id='corr319.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='justfied'>justified</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_319.6'>justified</a></span> in so thinking, for
the general populace of Korea never has risen in protest unless
the evils under which they are suffering have driven
them to the last court of appeal, mob law. The move was in
the direction of democracy and no one can judge that the
people of Korea are ready for any such thing.</p>

<p class='c000'>However this may be, a mass meeting was held at Chong-no,
to which representatives of all classes were called. The
following articles were formulated and presented to the
cabinet for imperial sanction.</p>

<p class='c000'>(1) Neither officials nor people shall depend upon foreign
aid, but shall do their best to strengthen and uphold the Imperial
power.</p>

<p class='c000'>(2) All documents pertaining to foreign loans, the hiring
of foreign soldiers, the granting of concessions, &amp;c., in fact
every document drawn up between the Korean government
and a foreign party or firm, shall be signed and sealed by all
the Ministers of State and the President of the Privy Council.</p>

<p class='c000'>(3) Important offenders shall be punished only after
they have been given a public trial and ample opportunity to
defend themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>(4) To His Majesty shall belong the power to appoint
Ministers, but in case a majority of the cabinet disapproves
of the Emperor’s nominee he shall not be appointed.</p>

<p class='c000'>(5) All sources of revenue and methods of raising taxes
shall be placed under the control of the Finance Department,
no other department or officer or corporation being allowed
to interfere therewith; and the annual estimates and balances
shall be made public.</p>

<p class='c000'>(6) The existing laws and regulations shall be enforced
without fear or favor.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be seen that several of these measures strike directly
at powers which have been held for centuries by the King
himself and it cannot be supposed that His Majesty would
listen willingly to the voice of the common people when they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>demanded such far-reaching innovations. The whole thing
was utterly distasteful to him, but the united voice of the people
is a serious matter. In such a country as Korea the
clearly announced statement of the common people as to their
wishes carries with it the implication that they have come to
the point where they are ready to make trouble if their demands
are not complied with. The intensity of the popular
feeling was shown in the general closing of shops and in the
attendance even of women upon the mass meetings. The reactionists
were seriously startled by these demonstrations, and
it became necessary to temporize. These demands were not
such as would involve any immediate changes; they all looked
to the future. So it was an easy matter simply to comply
with the demands and wait for the public feeling to subside.
On the last day of September His Majesty ordered the carrying
out of these six propositions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The trouble was that the conservatives felt that they had
not sufficient physical power to oppose a popular uprising.
The temporary concession was made with no idea of real compliance,
and was immediately followed by measures for securing
a counter demonstration. The instrument selected for
this purpose was the old-time Peddlar’s Guild. This was a defunct
institution, but the name survived, and the conservatives
used it to bring together a large number of men who
were ready for any sort of work that would mean pay. These
were organized into a company whose duty it was to run
counter to all popular demonstrations like those which had just
been made. No sooner was this hireling band organized than
His Majesty, in pursuance of the hint dropped some months
before by the President of the Independence Club, ordered
the disbanding of the Club. From this time on the Independence
Club was no longer recognized by the Government
and was an illegal institution, by the very terms of the unfortunate
admission of its President that the Emperor could
at any time disband it by Imperial decree. Mr. Yun Chi-ho
had by this time come to see that the Club was running to
dangerous extremes and was likely to cause serious harm;
and he and others worked with all their power to curb the
excitement and secure rational action on the part of the
members of the Club. But the time when such counsels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>could prevail had already passed. The Club knew that the
principles it advocated were correct and it was angry at the
stubborn opposition that it met. It was ready to go to any
lengths to secure its ends. Passion took the place of judgment
and the overthrow of the opposition loomed larger in
its view than the accomplishment of its rational ambitions.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><em>“GREAT ROCK”—TA-BA-WI GOLD-BEARING QUARTZ.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Instead of dispersing in compliance with the Imperial
order the assembled Independents went in a body to the
Police Headquarters and asked to be arrested. This is a
peculiarly Korean mode of procedure, the idea being that if
put on trial they would be able to shame their adversaries;
and incidentally it embarrassed the <a id='corr321.12'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='adminstration'>administration</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_321.12'>administration</a></span>, for the
prisons would not suffice to hold the multitude that clamored
for incarceration. The crowd was altogether too large and
too determined for the Peddlers to attack and another concession
had to be made. The Independents, for it can no longer
be called the Independent Club, offered to disperse on condition
that they be guaranteed freedom of speech. The
demand was immediately complied with; anything to disperse
that angry crowd which under proper leadership might at
any moment do more than make verbal demands. So on the
next day an Imperial decree granted the right of free speech.
This concession, likewise, was followed by a hurried muster of
all the peddlars and their more complete organization.
Backed by official aid and Imperial sanction they were prepared
to come to blows with the people who should assemble
for the purpose of making further demands upon the Emperor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shortly before this the Emperor had consented to the
proposition that the Independence Club should choose by
ballot from their own number twenty-five men who should
sit in the Privy Council. This council had for a time exercised
some influence during the earlier months of Dr.
Jaisohn’s residence in Seoul but it had lost all power and had
become a limbo to which were politely relegated those whom
the government did not care to use and yet was unwilling to
dismiss. The edict of the Emperor disbanding the Club
would be supposed to countermand this order for election, but
the Independents themselves did not so view it, and the day
set for the election was November 5th. The conservatives
now deemed themselves strong enough to try conclusions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>with the outlawed Club and before daylight of November 5th
seventeen of the leading men of the Independence Club were
arrested and lodged in jail, Mr. Yun, the president, narrowly
escaped arrest. It was afterwards ascertained that
the plan of the captors was to kill the president of the Club
before he could receive aid from the enraged people.</p>

<p class='c000'>When morning came and the arrest became known the
city hummed like a bee-hive. A surging crowd was massed
in front of the Supreme Court demanding loudly the release
of the prisoners who had been accused, so the anonymous
placards announced, of conspiring to establish a republic!
Again the popular feeling was too strong for the courage of
the peddlar thugs and they remained in the back-ground.
The agitation continued all that day and the next, and the next,
until the authorities were either frightened into submission
or, deeming that they had shown the Independents a glimpse
of what they might expect, released the arrested men. But
the Independents, so far from being cowed, hailed this
as a vindication of their policy and attempted to follow up
the defeat of the conservatives by demanding the arrest and
punishment of the people who had played the trick upon the
Club. As these men were very prominent officials and had
the ear of the Emperor it was not possible to obtain the redress
demanded. So the month of November wore away in a
ferment of excitement. Popular meetings were frequent but
the crowd had not the determination to come to conclusions
with the government. The conservatives saw this and with
utmost nicety gauged the resisting power of the malcontents.
The offensive tactics of the latter were confined merely to
free speech and the conservatives determined to see what
they would do when on the defensive. Accordingly on the
morning of November 21st a band of ruffians, the so-called
peddlars, attacked the people who had gathered as usual to
discuss the stirring questions of the times. Weapons were
used and a number of people were injured. The Independents
had never contemplated the use of force, and this brutal assault
aroused the ire of the whole people, most of
whom had not as yet taken sides. Serious hand to hand
fights occurred in various parts of the city and the peddlars,
conscious that even their most murderous attacks would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>condoned in high places, attempted to whip the people into
something like quietude.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 26th of November in the midst of this chaotic
state of things the Emperor granted a great general audience
outside the great gate of the palace. The Independence
Club was there in force, and foreign representatives and a
large number of other foreign residents. It was a little
Runnymede but with a different ending. Yun Chi-ho was
naturally the spokesman of the Independence party. He
made a manly and temperate statement of the position of his
constituents. He denounced the armed attacks of the peddlars
upon people who intended no violence but only desired
the fulfillment of solemnly made pledges. He called to account
those who imputed to the Independence Club traitorous
designs. He urged that the legal existence of the Club
should be again established by Imperial decree and that the
six measures so definitely and distinctly promised by His
Majesty should be carried out. There was no possible
argument to oppose to these requests and the Emperor
promised to shape the policy of the government in line with
these suggestions. Again it was mere promise, made to tide
over an actual and present difficulty. The Independence
people should have recognized this. The Emperor was surrounded
by men inimical to the reform program, they had
the police and the army back of them as well as the peddlars.
The Independence party had not a single prominent representative
in any really responsible and influential government
office. They simply had right and the precarious voice
of Korean popular feeling behind them. What was necessary
was a campaign of education. The program advocated was
one that could be carried out only under a government whose
personnel was at least approximately up to the standard of
that program. This could be claimed of only two or three
members of the Independence Club. Having secured this
public promise of His Majesty the club should have waited
patiently to see what would happen and if the promises were
not kept they should have waited and worked for a time
when public sentiment among the leading men would compel
reform. But as Mr. Yun himself confesses, “The popular
meetings had gone beyond the control of the <a id='corr323.40'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Indepedence'>Independence</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_323.40'>Independence</a></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>Club and in the face of strong advice to the <a id='corr324.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='contrry'>contrary</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_324.1'>contrary</a></span> they
were resumed on December 6th and their language became
careless and impudent. On the sixteenth of December the
Privy Council recommended the recall of Pak Yong-hyo from
Japan. The popular meeting had the imprudence to endorse
this action. The more conservative portion of the people
revolted against the very mention of the name. Suspicion
was excited that the popular agitations had been started in
the interests of Pak Yong-hyo and they instantly lost the
sympathy of the people.” The enemies of the liberal party
had probably used this argument to its fullest extent, and
when it was seen that the Independence movement had at
last been deprived of its strongest support, the popular voice,
its enemies came down upon it with cruel force. In spite of
voluble promises to the contrary large numbers of the
reform party were arrested and thrown into prison; not, to
be sure, on the change of being members of this party, but
on trumped-up charges of various kinds, especially, that of
being accessory to the plan of bringing back Pak Yong-hyo.
And thus came to an end a political party whose aims were
of the highest character, whose methods were entirely
peaceable but whose principles were so far in advance of the
times that from the very first there was no human probability
of success. But, as Mr. Yun Chi-ho said, though the party
dies the principles which it held will live and eventually
succeed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The year 1899 opened with political matters in a more
quiet state than for some years past, owing to the violent repression
of the Independence Club and the liberal movement.
The judgment of the future will be that at this point Japan
made a serious mistake of omission. The aims and purposes
of the Independence party were directly in line with Japanese
interests here and if that powerful government had actively
interested itself in the success of the movement and had
taken it for granted that the plan was to be definitely carried
out the succeeding years would have made very different history
than they did. But during all this time Japan seems to
have retired into comparative quietude, perhaps because she
saw the coming of her inevitable struggle with Russia and
was not willing to hasten matters by coming into premature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>conflict with the northern power in Korea, pending the completion
of her preparations for the supreme struggle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Through all this period Russian influence was quietly at
work securing its hold upon the Korean Court and upon such
members of the government as it could win over. The general
populace was always suspicious of her, however, and always
preferred the rougher hand of Japan to the soft but
heavy hand of Russia. The progress of the Russian plans was
illustrated when in January of 1899 a mission of the Greek
Church was established in Seoul. This suggests some remarks
upon the general subject of mission work in Korea.
The Presbyterian Church of America had established work
here in 1884: the Methodist Episcopal Church of America began
work in 1885; the Australian Presbyterian Church in
1889; The English Church Mission in 1890; the Southern
Presbyterian Church of America in 1892; the Southern
Methodist Church of America in 1896; the Canadian Presbyterian
Mission in 1898. Besides these there was independent
work under some smaller bodies including one Baptist
organization and one college mission. When the last year
of the 19th century opened these missions had all become
firmly established, and important centres of mission work
were found all over the country, especially in Seoul, Chemulpo,
Pyeng-yang, Fusan, Wonsan, Chun-ju, Kunsan,
Mokpo, Tă-gu and Song-do. From the very first the Protestant
Missions adopted the principle of non-interferance
with political affairs and with the ordinary course of justice
in Korean courts. It has not always been possible to follow
this principle implicitly but the people have come to learn
that connection with a Protestant Christian Church will not
absolve them from their duties and obligations toward their
own government nor shield them from the results of misconduct.
It has been found that the Korean temperament
makes him easily accessible to the rational idealism of
Christianity. From the very first the form of Christianity
presented by the Protestant missionaries took hold of the
Koreans with great power and by the end of the first fifteen
years of work the various missions had some twenty thousand
adherents. The northern station of the Presbyterian Mission
in Korea attained world-wide notice as being, so far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>as human estimate can go, the most successful mission station
in the world; and this not merely because of the number of
people received into Church connection but because of the
striking results obtained along the line of self support and
independent Christian work. Hospitals were established in
Seoul, Fusan, Wonsan, Pyeng-yang, Tă-gu and Chemulpo,
and schools of various grades both for boys and girls were
established in almost every mission station. The work of
Bible translation was carried on steadily until by the end of
1899 the whole of the New Testament was put in the hands
of the people at least in tentative form. The Korean Religious
Tract Society, established early in the last decade of
the century, did heroic work in putting forth Christian
literature of all kinds. Literary work was represented in
various grammars and manuals of Korean, several hymnals,
an unabridged dictionary and the publication of a monthly
magazine in English called <cite>The Korean Repository</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before going forward into the new century we should
note some of the more important material advances that
Korea had made. Railway concessions for some 600 miles
of track had been granted, half to Japanese and half to a
French syndicate; several new and important ports had been
opened, bringing the total number up to ten, inclusive of
Seoul and Pyeng-yang; mining concessions had been given
to Americans, English, Germans, French and Japanese, two
of which had proved at least reasonably successful; timber
and whaling concessions had been given to Russians on the
east side of the peninsula and important fishing rights had
been given to the Japanese; an attempt at a general system
of education had been made throughout the country and the
work of publishing text books was being pushed; students
were sent abroad to acquire a finished education and
legations at all the most important political centers were
established; an attempt at a better currency had been
made, though it was vitiated by official corruption and the
operations of counterfeiters; trade had steadily increased
and the imports and exports of Korea passed beyond the
<a id='corr326.38'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>negligeable</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_326.38'>negligeable</a></span> stage; an excellent postal system had been
inaugurated under foreign supervision, and Korea had entered
the Postal Union.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>Thus it will be seen that in spite of all domestic political
complications and discouragements the country was making
definite advance along some lines. The leaven had begun
to work and no conservatism on the part of the public leaders
could stop the ferment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The necrology of the closing year of the century contains

employers as an able and efficient man in his official capacity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The return to Seoul of M. Pavlow on Jan. 15, 1900,
marked the definite beginning of that train of events which
led up to the declaration of war by the Japanese in 1904.
The Russians had been induced, two years previously, to remove
the heavy pressure which they had brought to bear
upon the government, but it was only a change of method.
They were now to adopt a policy of pure intrigue and by
holding in power Koreans who were hostile to the Japanese
to <a id='corr327.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>harrass</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_327.31'>harrass</a></span> and injure Japanese interests in every way
possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this same time we see a clear indication of the trend
of events in the return to Korea of An Kyŭng-su and Kwan
Yŭng-jin, two of the best men that late years had developed
in Korea. They had been charged with connection with the
plot to compass the abdication of His Majesty, and had taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>refuge in Japan. Now on the promise of the government
that they should have a perfectly fair trial and on the
guarantee of protection by the Japanese they returned boldly
to Korea and presented themselves for trial. They were
strong men and they had to be reckoned with. They strongly
favored Japanese influence and the reforms that that influence
was supposed to embody. In fact they were thoroughly
in sympathy with the best motives of the defunct
Independence Club. An Kyŭng-su returned on January fifteenth
and was held in detention until May sixteenth when
Kwan Yŭng-jin returned. They were to stand a fair trial,
but on the night of the twenty-seventh of May they were
both strangled secretly in the prison. No more dastardly
crime ever stained the annals of this or any other government.
Induced to return on the promise of a fair trial they
were trapped and murdered. The reactionists looked upon
this as a signal victory, and indeed it was such, for it indicated
clearly that a man was not safe even when he had the
guarantee of the Japanese authorities. Nor would it be difficult
to indicate the source from which the government
obtained the courage thus to flout the Japanese.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the summer came on, all interest in things Korean
was held in suspension while the great uprising in China
swelled to such monstrous proportions and the investment of
Peking and the siege of the foreign legations there left the
world no time to care for or think of other things. There were
fears that the boxer movement would be contagious and that
it would spread to Korea. Indeed it was reported in the
middle of July that the infection had reached northern Korea;
but fortunately this proved false.</p>

<p class='c000'>In spite of the reactionary policy of the government
progress continued to be made on certain lines, just as the
momentum of a railway train cannot be checked the moment
the brakes are applied. A distinguished French legalist was
employed as adviser to the Law Department; mining concessions
were granted to British, French and Japanese syndicates;
the Government Middle School was established; the
Seoul-Chemulpo Railway was formally opened; a French
teacher was engaged to open a School of Mines; a representative
was sent to the great Paris Exposition.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>This year 1900 was the heyday of another <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parvenu</span></em> in the
person of Kim Yŭng-jun. He was a man without any backing
except his own colossal effrontery. He had acquired influence
by his ability to get together considerable sums of
money irrespective of the methods employed. Scores of
wealthy men were haled to prison on one pretext or another
and were released only upon the payment of a heavy
sum. He was a man of considerable force of character
but like so many adventurers in Korea he was lured by his
successes into a false feeling of security and he forgot that
the history of this country is full of just such cases and that
they inevitably end in violent death. Even the fate of Kim
Hong-nyuk did not deter him, though his case was almost the
counterpart of that victim of his own overweening ambitions.
Against Kim Yŭng-jun was ranged the whole nobility of the
country who waited with what patience they could until his
power to extort money began to wane, and then fell upon him
like wolves upon a belated traveler at night. But it was not
until the opening of the new year 1901 that he was deposed,
tried and killed in a most horrible manner. After excruciating
tortures he was at last strangled to death.</p>

<p class='c000'>But even as this act was perpetrated and the fate of all
such adventurers was again illustrated, another man of the
same ilk was pressing to the fore. This was Yi Yong-ik, who
had once been the <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">major domo</span></em> of one of the high officials and
in that capacity had learned how to do all sorts of interesting,
if unscrupulous, things. He was prominent in a felonious
attempt to cheat the ginseng farmers of Song-do out of thousands,
back in the eighties. He was an ignorant boor and
even when rolling in <a id='corr329.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='oppulence'>opulence</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_329.30'>opulence</a></span> failed to make himself presentable
in dress or manner. He was praised by some for his
scorn of luxury and because he made no attempt to hoard
the money that he bled from the veins of the people. The
reason he did not hoard it was the same that makes the farmer
sow his seed, that he may reap a hundred-fold. Yi Yong-ik
sowed his golden seed in fertile soil and it yielded him a
<a id='corr329.37'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='thousand fold'>thousand-fold</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_329.37'>thousand-fold</a></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of his favorite methods of obtaining money for his
patron was to cause the arrest of shoals of former prefects
who for one cause or another had failed to turn into the public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>treasury the complete amount nominally levied upon their
respective districts. These arrears went back several years
and many of them were for cause. Either famine or flood or
some other calamity had made it impossible for the people to
pay the entire amount of their taxes. There were many
cases, without doubt, in which it was right to demand the
money from the ex-prefects, for they had “eaten” it themselves;
but there were also many cases in which it was a
genuine hardship. Literally hundreds of men were haled
before a court and made to pay over large sums of money,
in default of which their property was seized as well as that of
their relatives. In exact proportion as the huge sums
thus extorted paved his way to favor in high places, in that
same proportion it drove the people to desperation. The
taking off of Kim Yŭng-jin, so far from warning this man,
only opened a larger door for the exercise of his peculiar
abilities, and it may be said that the official career of Yi
Yong-ik began with the opening of 1901.</p>

<p class='c000'>In March a Japanese resident of Chemulpo claimed to
have purchased the whole of Roze Island in the harbor of
Chemulpo. The matter made a great stir, for it was plain
that someone had assumed the responsibility of selling the
island to the Japanese. This was the signal for a sweeping
investigation which was so manipulated by powerful parties
that the real perpetrators of the outrage were <a id='corr330.25'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='desmissed'>dismissed</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_330.25'>dismissed</a></span> as
guiltless, but a side-issue which arose in regard to certain
threatening letters that were sent to the foreign legations
was made a peg upon which to hang the seizure, trial and execution
of Kim Yŭng-jun as before mentioned. Min Yŭng-ju
was the man who sold the island to the Japanese and he
finally had to put down Y35,000 and buy it back.</p>

<p class='c000'>Russia made steady advances toward her ultimate goal
during the year 1901. In the Spring some buildings in connection
with the palace were to be erected and the Chief
Commissioner of Customs, J. McLeavy Brown, C. M. G., was
ordered to vacate his house on the customs compound at
short notice. Soldiers even forced their way into his house.
This affront was a serious one and one that the Koreans
would never have dared to give had they not felt that they
had behind them a power that would see them through.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>The British authorities soon convinced the government that
such tactics could be easily met and it had to retreat with
some loss of dignity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Russian Church established itself in Seoul at this
time and took active steps to start a propaganda in Korea.
Considerable disturbance was caused in the Southern provinces
by Koreans who had become Russian subjects pretending
to be agents of the Russian church and collecting from
the people large sums of money by intimidation. For
many months the Russians tried to induce the Koreans to
allow the Korean telegraph lines in the North-east to be
connected with the Russian line from Vladivostock. Why
this should not be done we cannot see but evidently the Koreans
considered it a national danger and, try as they might,
the Russians never really succeeded in making the connection.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Russians and French were naturally working together
in the peninsula and when Russia adopted the
principle of withdrawing her military instructors from Korea
she so manipulated the wires that the government threw
many positions into the hands of the French. For the next
three years the French population of Seoul increased many-fold.
Many of the French gentlemen employed by the
government were thoroughly competent and rendered good
service but their presence tended to add to the tension between
Japan and Russia, for it was quite plain that all their
influence would be thrown in the scale on Russia’s side.
The attempt to loan the Korean Government Y5,000,000 was
pushed with desperate vigor for many months by the French,
but divided counsels prevented the final consummation of the
loan and the French thus failed to secure the strong leverage
which a heavy loan always gives to the creditor. Yi Yong-ik
who had become more or less of a Russian tool was
pointedly accused by the Japanese of being in favor of the
French loan but he vigorously denied it. It is generally
admitted that Yi Yong-ik was something of a mystery even
to his most intimate acquaintances and just how far he really
favored the Russian side will never be known, but it is <a id='corr331.37'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='certian'>certain</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_331.37'>certain</a></span>
that he assumed a more and more hostile attitude toward
the Japanese as the months went by, an attitude which
brought him into violent conflict with them, as we shall see.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>Yi Yong-ik posed as a master in finance, whatever else he
may or may not have been, and in 1901 he began the minting of
the Korean nickel piece. No greater monetary disaster ever
overtook this country. Even the desperate measures taken
by the Regent thirty years before had not shaken the monetary
system as this did. The Regent introduced the wretched
five-cash piece which did enormous harm but that five-cash
piece was of too small face value to be worth counterfeiting.
The nickel was the ideal coin to tempt the counterfeiter,
for its intrinsic value was not so great as to require the
employment of a large amount of capital and yet its face
value was sufficient to pay for the labor and time expended.
The effects of this departure will be noted in their place.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the summer of 1901 Yi Yong-ik performed one act
that, in the eyes of the people, covered a multitude of other
sins. It was a year of great scarcity. The Korean farmers
raised barely enough grain for domestic consumption and in
order to prevent this grain from being taken out of the country
the government proclaimed an embargo on its export. In
spite of the fact that Japan was enjoying an unusually good
crop and did not really need the Korean product, the Japanese
authorities, in the interest of the Japanese exporters in
Korea, brought pressure to bear upon the Korean government
to raise the embargo, utterly regardless of the interests of the
Korean people. As it turned out however, the enhanced price
in Korea due to the famine and the cutting of a full crop in
Japan prevented the export of rice. But Yi Yong-ik saw that
there would inevitably be a shortage in Seoul and with much
forethought he sent and imported a large amount of Annam
rice and put it on the market at a price so reasonable that
the people were highly gratified. From that time on whenever
the mistakes of Yi Yong-ik were cited there was
always someone to offer the extenuation of that Annam
rice. It was a most clever and successful appeal to popular
favor.</p>

<p class='c000'>All through this year 1901 were heard the distant rumblings
of that storm that was to break three years later.
Every movement of the Russians by land or sea was watched
with a fascinated attention and every proposition of the Japanese
was closely scrutinized. As a fact the war was already in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>existence, only it had not been declared. Even then Japanese
agents were swarming all over Manchuria gaining exact
information of its geography and products and Japan was
hastening the preparation of her navy for the struggle that
she felt to be inevitable.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the year 1901 came to a close the tension was beginning
to be felt. People were asking how much longer Japan
would acquiesce in the insolent encroachments of Russia. But
the time was not yet. As for material advances the year had
seen not a few. Seoul had been supplied with electric light.
The Seoul-Fusan Railway had been begun. Plans for the
Seoul-Wiju Railway had been drawn up. Mokpo had been
supplied with a splendid sea-wall. Building had gone on
apace in the capital and even a scheme for a system of water-works
for the city had been worked out and had received
the sanction of the government. Education had gone from
bad to worse and at one time when retrenchment seemed
necessary it was even suggested to close some of the schools,
but better counsels prevailed and this form of suicide was
rejected.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the opening of the year 1902 there were several indications
that the general <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morale</span></em> of the government was deteriorating.
The first was a very determined attempt to revive
the Buddhist cult. The Emperor consented to the establishment
of a great central monastery for the whole country
in the vicinity of Seoul, and in it was installed a Buddhist
High Priest in Chief who was to control the whole Buddhist
Church in the land. It was a ludicrous attempt, for Buddhism
in Korea is dead so far as any genuine influence is concerned.
Mixed with the native spirit-worship it has its millions
of devotees, but so far as becoming a fashionable cult is
concerned nothing is more unlikely. But it has been the
case for over a thousand years that when things have gone
badly in the government there has been a harking back to the
old Buddhist mummery, to fortune-tellers, geomancers and the
like, and the only significance of this attempt was to prove
that there was something “rotten in Denmark.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Another evidence was the constant and successful attempt
to centralize the power of the Government in the hands
of the Emperor. The overthrow of the Independence Party,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>whose main tenet was curtailment of the Imperial prerogative,
gave a new impulse to the enlargement of that prerogative
so that in the year 1901 we find almost all the government
business transacted in the Palace itself. The various ministers
of state could do nothing on their own initiative.
Everything was centered in the throne and in two or three
favorites who stood near the throne. Of these Yi Yong-ik
was the most prominent.</p>

<p class='c000'>A third evidence of deterioration was the methods adopted
to fill the coffers of the Household treasury. The previous
year had been a bad one. Out of a possible twelve
million dollars of revenue only seven million could be
collected. There was great distress all over the country and
the pinch was felt in the palace. Special inspectors and
agents were therefore sent to the country armed with authority
from the Emperor to collect money for the Household
treasury. These men adopted any and every means to
accomplish their work and this added very materially to the
discontent of the people. The prefects were very loath to
forego a fraction of the taxation, because they saw how
previous prefects were being mulcted because of failure to
collect the full amount, and so between the prefect and the
special agents the people seemed to be promised a rather bad
time. In fact it caused such an outcry on every side that
the government at last reluctantly recalled the special
agents.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in the year the fact was made public that Korea
had entered into an agreement with Russia whereby it was
guaranteed that no land at Masanpo or on the island of Kö-je
at its entrance should ever be sold or permanently leased to
any foreign Power. Russia had already secured a coaling
station there and it was generally understood, the world
over, that Russia had special interest in that remarkably
fine harbor. Avowedly this was merely for pacific purposes,
but the pains which Russia took to make a secret agreement
with Korea debarring other Powers from privileges similar to
those which she had acquired, naturally aroused the suspicions
of the Japanese and of the Koreans themselves, those of
them that had not been in the secret; and this step, inimical
to Japan as it undoubtedly was, probably helped to hasten the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>final catastrophe. Meanwhile Russian subjects were taking
advantage of the influential position of their Government in
Seoul and through <a id='corr335.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='ministeral'>ministerial</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_335.3'>ministerial</a></span> influence some glass-makers,
iron-workers and weavers were employed by the Government
without the smallest probability of their ever doing
anything in any of these lines. In fact at about this time the
Government was induced to take on quite a large number
of Russians and Russian sympathisers who never were able
to render any service whatever in lieu of their pay. In many
cases the most cursory investigation would have shown that
such would inevitably be the result. It is difficult to evade
the conclusion that the Government was deliberately
exploited.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was in the spring of this year that the project began to
be seriously discussed in Japan of colonizing portions of
Korea with Japanese, and a society or company was formed
in Tokyo with this as its avowed purpose. This naturally
evoked a good deal of feeling in Korea where the Japanese
were not at the time enjoying any considerable influence at
court. The fact then came out for the first time, and has
been further emphasized since, that the Korean, whatever he
may feel for his Government, is passionately attached to the
soil.</p>

<p class='c000'>But at this time another and a far greater surprise was in
store for the world. It was the announcement of a defensive
alliance between Japan and Great Britain. By the terms of
this agreement Japan and Great Britain guaranteed to insure
the independence of Korea and the integrity of the Chinese
Empire. The tremendous influence of this historic document
was felt at once in every capital of Europe and in every capital,
port and village of the Far East. It stung the lethargic
to life and it caused the rashly <a id='corr335.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='enthusiaatic'>enthusiastic</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_335.32'>enthusiastic</a></span> to stop and think.
There can be no manner of doubt that this alliance was one
of the necessary steps in preparing for the war which Japan
already foresaw on the horizon. It indicated clearly to Russia
that her continued occupation of Manchuria and her continued
encroachments upon Korea would be called in question
at some not distant day. But she was blind to the warning.
This convention bound Great Britain to aid Japan in defensive
operations and to work with her to the preservation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>Korean independence and the integrity of China. It will be
seen, therefore, that Japan gave up once and for all any
thought that she might previously have had of impairing the
independence of this country and any move in that direction
would absolve Great Britain from all obligations due to the
signing of the agreement.</p>

<p class='c000'>The year had but just begun when the operations of
counterfeiters of nickel coins became so flagrant as to demand
the attention of all who were interested in trade in the peninsula.
Japan had most at stake and Russia had least, and
this explains why the Russian authorities applauded the work
of Yi Yong-ik and encouraged him to continue and increase
the issue of such coinage. In March matters had come to
such a pass that the foreign representatives, irrespective of
partisan lines, met and discussed ways and means for overcoming
the difficulty. After careful deliberation they framed
a set of recommendations which were sent to the Government.
These urged the discontinuance of this nickel coinage, the
withdrawal from circulation of spurious coins and stringent
laws against counterfeiting. But this was of little or no
avail. The Government was making a five cent coin at a
cost of less than two cents and consequently the counterfeiters
with good tools could make as good a coin as the Government
and still realize enormously on the operation. It was impossible
to detect the counterfeited coins, in many cases, and so
there was no possibility of withdrawing them from circulation.
The heavy drop in exchange was not due so much to the
counterfeiting as to the fact that the intrinsic value of the
coin was nothing like as much as the face value, and by an
immutable law of finance as well as of human nature it fell to
a ruinous discount. But even this would not have worked
havoc with trade if, having fallen, the discredited coinage
would stay fallen, but it had the curious trick of rising and
falling with such sudden fluctuations that business became a
mere gamble, and the heavy interests of Japanese and Chinese
merchants were nearly at a standstill.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this point the First Bank of Japan, called the Dai
Ichi Ginko, brought up a scheme for putting out an issue of
special bank notes that would not circulate outside of Korea.
Korea was importing much more than she exported and the
balance of trade being against her it was impossible to keep
Japanese paper in the country in sufficient quantities to carry
on ordinary local trade. For this reason the bank received
the sanction of the Korean Government to put out this issue
of bank paper which could not be sent abroad but would be
extremely useful as a local currency. This was done and it
was found to work admirably. The Koreans had confidence
in this money and it circulated freely. It had two advantages
not enjoyed by any form of Korean currency, namely, it was
a stable currency and suffered no fluctuations and it was in
large enough denominations to make it possible to transfer a
thousand dollars from one man’s pocket to that of another
without employing a string of pack-ponies to carry the
stuff.</p>

<p class='c000'>But we must retrace our steps and note some other
events of interest that happened in the spring months. One
of these was the scare in government circles over the reported
revival of the Independence Club under the encouragement
of a so-called Korean Party in Tokyo, to which it was
believed some Korean political refugees belonged. A great
stir was made in Seoul and several men were arrested, but
there was no evidence that would pay sifting, and though it
was evident that the government would have been glad to
find a true bill against some of the men who were arrested it
was forced by lack of evidence to let them go. The incident
was of importance only as showing the extreme sensitiveness
of the government on the point, and its determination,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>now that the Independence Party was down, to keep
it down.</p>

<p class='c000'>The one important material improvement of the year
was the adoption of a plan for the building of some thirty
light-houses on the coast of Korea. Ever since the opening
up of foreign trade the lack of proper lights especially on the
western coast had been a matter of growing concern to
shipping companies. This concern was warranted by the
dangerous nature of the coast where high tides, a perfect network
of islands and oft-prevailing fogs made navigation a
most difficult and dangerous matter. The fact that light-houses
ought to have been built ten years ago does not detract
from the merit of those who at last took the matter in
hand and pushed it to an issue.</p>

<p class='c000'>The month of May witnessed a spectacular event in the
ceremony of the formal opening of work on the Seoul-Wiju
Railway. The spirit was willing but the flesh was weak.
Neither French nor Russian money was forthcoming to push
the work, and so the Korean government was invited to finance
the scheme. Yi Yong-ik was made president of the
company and if there had been a few thousand more ex-prefects
to mulct he might have raised enough money to
carry the road a few miles; but it is much to be feared that
his financial ability, so tenderly touched upon by the Japanese
Minister in his speech on that “auspicious occasion,” was
scarcely sufficient for the work, and the plan was not completed.
There is much reason to believe that this whole
operation was mainly a scheme on the part of the Russians
to preempt the ground in order to keep the Japanese
out.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the year wore toward its close the usurpation of numerous
offices by Yi Yong-ik and his assumption of complete
control in the palace bore its legitimate fruit in the intense
hatred of four-fifths of the entire official class. He was
looked upon as but one more victim destined to the same
fate which had overtaken Kim Hong-nyuk and Kim Yŭng-jun.
But in his case the difficulties were much greater.
Yi Yong-ik had put away in some safe place an enormous
amount of Government money and he held it as a hostage
for his personal safety. Until that money was safely in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>Imperial treasury even the revenge would not be sweet
enough to make it worth the loss. Not only so but the
whole finances of the Household were in his hands and his
sudden taking off would leave the accounts in such shape
that no one could make them out, and enormous sums due
the department would be lost. Yi Yong-ik had fixed himself
so that his life was better worth than his death however
much that might be desired. But the officiary at large cared
little for this. There was no doubt that the one person who
should accomplish the overthrow of the favorite and thus bring
embarrassment to the Imperial purse would suffer for it, but
Korean intrigue was quite capable of coping with a little
difficulty like this. The result must be brought about by a
combination so strong and so unanimous that no one would
ever know who the prime mover was. This at least is a
plausible theory and the only one that adequately explains
how and why the scheme miscarried. The whole course of
the intrigue is so characteristically Korean and includes so
many elements of <a id='corr339.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='guinune'>genuine</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_339.20'>genuine</a></span> humor, in spite of its object, that
we will narrate it briefly. It must of course be understood
that the officials were keenly on the lookout for an opportunity
to get the hated favorite on the hip and in such a
manner that even his financial value to the Emperor would
not avail him.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day, while in conversation with Lady Om, the Emperor’s
favorite concubine who has been mistress of the palace
since the death of the Queen, Yi Yong-ik compared her to
Yang Kwi-bi a concubine of the last Emperor of the Tang
dynasty in China. He intended this as a compliment but as
his education is very limited he was not aware that he could
have said nothing more insulting; for Kwi-bi by her meretricious
arts is believed to have brought about the destruction
of the Tang dynasty. At the time Lady Om herself was
unaware that anything derogatory had been said and she
received the supposed compliment with complacency; but
her nephew who was present, not understanding the
reference, went and asked someone else about it and learned
the truth of the matter. He doubtless knew that Yi Yong-ik
was not aware of his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>gaucherie</em></span> and so held his peace for a
time, but in some way the Prime Minister and the Foreign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>Minister heard a rumor that something insulting had been
said. They called up the nephew of Lady Om and from him
learned the damning facts. They also knew well enough
that no insult had been intended but here was a “case” to
be worked to its fullest capacity. The most sanguine could
not hope that the hated favorite would give them a better
hold upon him than this: for the position of Lady Om was
a very delicate one and there had been a dispute on for years
between the Emperor’s counsellors as to the advisability of
raising her to the position of Empress. A word against her
was a most serious matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Everything was now ready for the grand <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</span></em> and on the
27th of <a id='corr340.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Novenber'>November</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_340.13'>November</a></span> fourteen of the highest officials memorialized
the throne declaring that Yi Yong-ik was a traitor and must
be condemned and executed at once. His Majesty suggested
a little delay but on the evening of the same day the same
men presented a second memorial couched in still stronger
language, and they followed if up the next morning with a
third. To their urgent advice was added that of Lady Om
herself and of many other of the officials. A crowd of officials
gathered at the palace gate and on their knees awaited the
decision of the Emperor. There was not a single soul of all
that crowd but knew that the charge was a mere excuse and
yet it was nominally valid. It was the will of that powerful
company against the will of the Emperor. The tension was
<a id='corr340.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='two'>too</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_340.26'>too</a></span> great and His Majesty at last reluctantly consented, or
at least expressed consent; but he first ordered the accused
to be stripped of all his honors and to render all his accounts.
This was nominally as reasonable as was the charge against
the man. It was a case of “diamond cut diamond” in which
the astuteness of the Emperor won. The accusers could not
object to having the accused disgorge before being executed
but it was at this very point that they were foiled Yi Yong-ik’s
accounts were purposely in such shape that it would
have taken a month to examine them, for he alone held the
key. Nothing can exceed the desperate coolness of the
man under the awful ordeal. At one point, just after the
acquiescence of the Emperor, the written sentence of death
is said to have gone forth but was recalled just as it was to
have gone out of the palace gates, after which there would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>have been no recall. No man ever escaped by a narrower
margin. When Yi Yong-ik presented his accounts the Emperor
announced that it would take some days to straighten
matters out since the accused was the only man to unravel
the skein. Here was probably the crucial point in the intrigue.
If the white heat of the day before had been maintained and
the officials had demanded instant punishment, accounts or
no accounts, the thing would have been done, but as it happened
the consciousness of having won relaxed the tension
to such a degree that the accused gained time. This time
was utilized by calling in a Russian guard and spiriting the
accused away to the Russian Legation. This accomplished
His Majesty suavely announced that the case would be considered,
but that meanwhile the officials must disperse.
There were further memorials, resignations <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</span></em>, passionate
recriminations until at last two or three officials who
had held their peace saw that the game was up and, in order
to curry favor themselves, offered a counter memorial charging
Yi Yong-ik’s accusers with indirection. This was
listened to and the Prime Minister was deprived of his official
rank. This made possible a compromise whereby both
Yi Yong-ik and the Prime Minister were restored to all their
former honors and all went “merry as a marriage bell.”
But it was thought best to let Yi Yong-ik travel for his own
and his country’s good, so he was made Commissioner to Buy
Annam Rice, which was itself a pretty piece of diplomacy
since it recalled prominently to the people the one phase of
the injured man’s career which they could unhesitatingly
applaud. He was taken off in a Russian cruiser to Port
Arthur—to buy Annam rice!</p>

<p class='c000'>When he returned to Seoul a few weeks later the Japanese
lodged a strong protest against his return to political
power but the Russian authorities made a counter-proposition
urging that he was the only man capable of handling the
finances of the country. Under existing circumstances the
very protest of the Japanese was an argument in his favor
and he came back into power on the flood tide, backed, as he
had never been before, by the full favor of the Russian party.
They naturally expected substantial payment for having
saved him, and so far as he was able he liquidated the debt.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>Meanwhile another man, Yi Keun-t’ăk, had risen to
power through servile <a id='corr342.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='adherance'>adherence</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_342.2'>adherence</a></span> to Russian interests. The
somewhat enigmatical character of Yi Yong-ik made him to
a certain extent an unknown quantity. Not even the Japanese
considered him wholly given over to Russia; but this new
man was definitely committed to Russian interests and with his
rise to important position it became evident for the first time
that the Korean Government had decided to rely upon Russia
and to reject the aid or the advice of Japan. The end of the
year 1902 may be said to have been the approximate time
when Japan first realized that all hope of a peaceful solution
of the Korean problem was gone. One naturally asks why
Korea took this step, and, while we are still too near the
event to secure an entirely dispassionate estimate or opinion,
there seems to be little doubt that it was because Russia
made no pretensions, and <a id='corr342.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='expessed'>expressed</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_342.26'>expressed</a></span> no desire, to reform the
administration of the Government. She was perfectly content
to let things go along in the old way in the peninsula, knowing
that this would constantly and increasingly jeopardize the
interests of Japan while she herself had practically no commercial
interests to suffer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The immemorial policy of Russia in Asia sufficiently
accounts for her work in Korea. Her policy of gradual
absorption of native tribes has never held within its purview
the civilizing or the strengthening of those tribes, until they
have been gathered under her aegis. On the other hand,
until that has been accomplished she has either waited patiently
for the disintegration of the native tribes or has actually
aided in such disintegration. History shows no case in which
Russia has strengthened the hands of another people for the
sake of profiting by the larger market that would be opened
up; for until very recently the commercial side of the
question has scarcely been considered, and even now the
commercial interests of Russia depend upon an exclusive
market. So that in any case a dominant political influence
is the very first step in every move of Russia in the East.
Why then should Russia have advised administrative or
monetary or any other reform, since such action would inevitably
form a bar to the success of her own ultimate
plans?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>The historian of the future, taking his stand above and
out of the smoke of battle, will take a dispassionate view of
the whole situation. He will mark the antecedents of these
two rival Powers, he will compare their domestic and foreign
policies, he will weigh the motives that impelled them, he
will mark the instruments wielded by each and the men
whom they employed as their intermediaries and agents.
Then and not till then will it be possible to tell whether the
present recorders of events are right in asserting that while
the policies of both Powers are essentially selfish the success
of Russia’s policy involves the disintegration and national
ruin of the peoples she comes in contact with while the success
of Japan’s policy demands the rehabilitation of the
Far East.</p>

<p class='c000'>Much depended upon the attitude which Korea should
finally assume toward these two mutually antagonistic
policies. If she had sided with Japan and had shown a fixed
determination to resist the encroachments of Russia by adopting
a policy of internal renovation which would enlist the interest
and command the admiration of the world, the present
war might have been indefinitely postponed. Whether it could
have been finally avoided would depend largely upon the
changes that are taking place in Russia herself where in
spite of all repressive agencies education and enlightenment
are filtering in and causing a gradual change. Here again
the future historian may be able to say with confidence that
it was better that the war came when it did in that it
confirmed Japan in her course of commercial, industrial and
intellectual expansion, guaranteed China against disintegration
and opened the eyes of the Russians themselves to their
need of radical internal reform. And he may be able to say
that the temporary suspension of Korean autonomy was but
a small price to pay for these enormous benefits to the Far
East and to the world at large.</p>

<p class='c007'>The year 1903 beheld the rapid culmination of the difficulties
between Japan and Russia. It had already become
almost sure that war alone would cut the Gordian knot, and
if any more proof was necessary this year supplied it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yi Yong-ik in Port Arthur received assurance from the
Emperor that if he returned he would be given a powerful
guard, and in this he was doubtless seconded by the Russians
who could use him to better advantage in Seoul than in Port
Arthur. He telegraphed for 15,000 bags of Annam rice and
arrived in Chemulpo on the very day the rice came. It
formed a sort of peace offering which, in the temporary
scarcity, was very agreeable to the people. His return was
the signal for a vigorous attack upon Japanese interests.
On the eleventh of the preceding September the Acting
Minister of Foreign Affairs had issued an order prohibiting
the use of the Japanese bank notes, alleging that since they
were not government notes they were unsafe. This was a
direct breach of faith, because as we have seen the Japanese
Bank had already obtained the full consent of the government
to issue and circulate these notes. It is almost inconceivable
that any man of ministerial rank would be so devoid
of ordinary common sense as to attempt such a thing as this.
Of course there was an instant and peremptory protest on the
part of the Japanese authorities and the government had to
stultify itself by taking it all back. The promise was made
that the governors of the provinces would be instructed to remove
all objections to the circulation of the notes, but the
promise was never kept. Now on the seventeenth of January
Yi Yong-ik, who had but just returned, made a fierce attack
upon the Japanese bank and a note was sent from the
Finance Department to that of Foreign Affairs demanding by
what right the latter had ventured to interfere in the finances of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>the country. Cho Pyŭng-sik who had reinstated the Japanese
notes was dismissed from the Foreign Office and everything
fell into the hands of Yi Yong-ik. A few days later the Mayor
of Seoul posted a circular forbidding the use of these notes
on pain of severe punishment. This went all over the country
and there was an immediate run on the bank, which was
tided over with the greatest difficulty. Of course the Japanese
were in a position to make reprisals, and after a little
pointed talk the bluster of the favorite subsided to a weak
whisper, and the authorities apologized in the most abject
manner. It should be noted that the Russians gave no help
to Yi Yong-ik when it came to the point of an actual breach
with Japan.</p>

<p class='c000'>For some time there had been great unrest throughout
the province of Whang-hă owing to the lawless acts of the
Roman Catholic adherents there. The matter was brought
clearly before the notice of the Government through American
Protestant missionaries because many of the Protestant native
Christians had been involved in those troubles and had
been imprisoned, beaten, tortured and robbed by those who
were avowedly members of the Roman Church. A number
of these lawless acts were committed under the sign and
seal of the Church itself. When the matter became too
notorious to escape action on the part of the Government
a native official named Yi Eung-ik was appointed as a
special Commissioner to go to Hă-ju, the capital <a id='corr345.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='missing word'>of</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_345.27'>of</a></span> the province,
and investigate the matter thoroughly. Foreign representatives
of both the Roman Catholics and of the Protestants
were present and the trial was instituted in a perfectly
fair and impartial manner. It was clear that the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth was to be elicited
by this trial and after vain attempts to quash the indictment
one of the French Catholic priests left the place accompanied
and followed by a considerable number of those against
whom there were most serious charges. These people
gathered at a certain town and assumed a threatening attitude
toward the Korean Government, but though all the
foreign Roman Catholic representatives refused to attend the
trial of the dozen or more of their adherents who had been
arrested, the trial continued and charge after charge of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>most grievous nature was proved, one man being convicted
of murder. During the trial various attempts were made to
discredit the Commissioner but before the end of the trials
his power was greatly increased. The result was to put an
end to the difficulties and though those responsible for the
outrages were never adequately punished it is probable that
the Korean Government sufficiently demonstrated its purpose
to deal with such matters in a strictly impartial manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great preponderance of Russian influence was
manifested early in 1903 by the decision on the part of the
Government to send a number of young Koreans to Russia
to study, but when it came to the point of selecting the men
it was found that there was no desire on the part of the
students to go. This was due in part to the feeling that
Korean students abroad are not looked after very carefully
by the authorities and there are long delays in, if not complete
cessation of, transmission of money for their support.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in the year it transpired that the Russians had
obtained from the Korean Emperor a concession to cut
timber along the Yalu River. The thing was done secretly
and irregularly and the government never received a tithe of
the value of the concession. By this act the government
dispossessed itself of one of its finest sources of wealth and
sacrificed future millions for a few paltry thousand in hand, and
a promise to pay a share of the profits, though no provision was
made for giving the government an opportunity of watching
the work in its own interests. Soon after the Russians had
begun to work the concession they began to make advances
for the obtaining of harbor facilities in connection with it.
The port of Yongampo was decided upon and the Korean government
was asked to allow the Russians the use of it for
this purpose. This created a very profound impression upon
Japan and upon the world at large. It was felt that this was
giving Russia a foothold upon the soil of Korea, and Russia’s
history shows that, once gained, the point would never be
given up. The activity of Russia in the north gave rise to
the notion that Japanese influence was predominant in the
southern half of the peninsula and Russian in the northern
half. This gave birth to all sorts of rumors among the Korean
people and the ancient books were ransacked for prophecies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>that would fit the situation. One of these is worth repeating
since it illustrates very perfectly the Korean tendency to
consult some oracle in times of national peril. This particular
prophecy is supposed to say that “when white pine-trees
grow in Korea the northern half of the peninsula will go to
the Tartar and the southern half to the Shrimp.” Japan, from
its shape, is said to resemble a shrimp, while Tartar covers the
Muscovite. The people interpreted the “white pines” to refer
to the telegraph poles! And thus the prophecy was considered
to mean that when Korea is opened to foreign intercourse
it will be divided between Russia and Japan. It cannot
be said that this caused any considerable stir among the
people and its only value lies in the certain indication that it
afforded of the general unrest and suspicion among them.
As a whole the attitude of the Korean has always been
a rational and consistent one as between Russia and Japan.
He has a greater personal antipathy for the latter because
they have come into closer contact, but there is a mysterious
dread in his heart which warns him of the Russian. He will
never say which he would rather have in power here, but
always says, “I pray to be delivered from them both.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Japan began to urge upon the government the necessity
of opening Yongampo to foreign trade, but Russia, of course,
opposed this with all her powers of persuasion. Great Britain
and the United States joined in urging the opening of
the port. The United States had already arranged for the
opening of the port of Antung just opposite Yongampo,
and for the sake of trade it was highly desirable that
a port on the Korean side of the Yalu should be opened. It
had no special reference to the Russian occupation of the
port, but as pressure was being brought to bear upon the government
to throw open the port it was considered an opportune
time to join forces in pushing for this desired end.
And it was more for the interest of Korea to do this than for
any of the powers that were urging it. Such an act would
have been a check to Russian aggression and would have
rendered nugatory any ulterior plan she might have as regards
Korea. But the Russian power in Seoul was too great.
It had not upheld the cause of Yi Yong-ik in vain, and the
government, while using very specious language, withstood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>every attempt to secure the opening of the port. At last the
American Government modified its request and asked that
Wiju be opened, but to this Russia objected almost as strongly
as to the other. There can be little doubt that this uncompromising
attitude of Russia on the Korean border confirmed
Japan in the position she had <a id='corr348.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='doubtlesss'>doubtless</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_348.6'>doubtless</a></span> already assumed.
It was quite evident that the force of arms was the
only thing that would make Russia retire from Korean
soil.</p>

<p class='c000'>All through the summer complaints came in from the
north that the Russians were working their own will along the
northern border and taking every advantage of the loose
language in which the agreement had been worded. Again
and again information came up to Seoul that the Russian
agents were going outside the limits specified in the bond but
there was no one to check it. It was impossible to police the
territory <a id='corr348.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='encroched'>encroached</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_348.17'>encroached</a></span> upon and there is reason to believe
that the Government chafed under the imposition. At least
the telegraph lines which the Russians erected entirely without
warrant were repeatedly torn down by emissaries of the
Government and apparently without check from the central
authorities.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Summer when the text of the proposed Agreement
between Russia and Korea anent Yongampo became public
the Japanese Government made a strong protest. She probably
knew that this was a mere form but she owed it to herself to
file a protest against such suicidal action on the part of Korea.
The insolence of the Russians swelled to the point of renaming
Yongampo Port Nicholas.</p>

<p class='c000'>In October the Japanese merchants in Seoul and other
commercial centers began calling in all outstanding moneys,
with the evident expectation of war. All brokers and loan
associations closed their accounts and refused to make further
loans. It is more than probable that they had received the
hint that it might be well to suspend operations for the time
being. From this time until war was declared the people of
Korea waited in utmost suspense. They knew war only as a
universal desolation. They had no notion of any of the comparative
amenities of modern warfare or the immunities of
noncombatants. War meant to them the breaking up of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>very foundations of society, and many a time the anxious inquiry
was put as to whether the war would probably be
fought on Korean soil or in Manchuria. Once more Korea
found herself the “Shrimp between two whales” and doubly
afflicted in that whichever one should win she would in all
probability form part of the booty of the victor.</p>

<p class='c000'>The year 1904, which will be recorded in history as one of
the most momentous in all the annals of the Far East, opened
upon a very unsatisfactory state of things in Korea. It had
become as certain as any future event can be that Japan and
Russia would soon be at swords points. The negotiations
between these two powers were being carried on in St. Petersburg
and, as published later, were of the most unsatisfactory
nature. Japan was completing her arrangements for striking
the blow which fell on February the ninth. Of course
these plans were not made public but there was conflict in the
very air and all men were bracing themselves for the shock
that they felt must soon come. The action of Japanese money-lenders
in suspending operations was followed in January by
the Korean pawn-brokers and at a season when such action
inflicted the <a id='corr349.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='greastest'>greatest</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_349.21'>greatest</a></span> possible harm upon the poor people of
the capital, who find it impossible to live without temporarily
hypothecating a portion of their personal effects. This together
with the excessive cold aroused a spirit of unrest
which came near assuming dangerous proportions. Some of
the native papers were so unwise as to fan the embers by dilating
upon the hard conditions under which the Koreans labored.
Their sharpest comments were directed at the Government
but their tendency was to incite the populace against
foreigners.</p>

<p class='c000'>All through the month the various foreign legations were
bringing in guards to protect their legations and their respective
nationals and this very natural and entirely justifiable
action was resented by the Government. It protested time
and again against the presence of foreign troops, as if their
coming were in some way an insult to Korea. The officials
in charge thereby showed their utter incompetence to diagnose
the situation correctly. It was well known that the
disaffection among the Korean troops in Seoul was great and
that the dangerous element known as the Peddlars Guild was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>capable of any excesses. The unfriendly attitude of Yi
Yong-ik and Yi Keun-tăk towards western foreigners, excepting
Russians and French, together with their more or less
close connection with the Peddlars was sufficient reason for
the precautionary measures that were adopted. But the native
papers made matters worse by ridiculing both the government
and the army. At one time there was considerable
solicitude on the part of foreigners, not lest the Korean populace
itself would break into open revolt but lest some violent
faction would be encouraged by the authorities to make
trouble; so little confidence had they in the good sense of the
court favorite. It was fairly evident that in case of trouble
the Japanese would very soon hold the capital and it was
feared that the violently pro-Russian officials, despairing of
protection at the hands of Russia, would cause a general
insurrection, hoping in the tumult to make good their escape.
It was felt that great precautions should be taken by foreigners
not to give any excuse for a popular uprising. The electric
cars diminished their speed so as to obviate the possibility of
any accident, for even the smallest casualty might form the
match while would set the people on fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>But popular unrest was not confined to Seoul. A serious
movement was begun in the two southern provinces where, it
was reported, hundreds of the <em>ajuns</em> or prefectural constables
were preparing to lead a formidable insurrection. The firm
hold that these men have upon the people made it not unlikely
that it would prove much more serious than the Tonghak
insurrection of 1894. From the north, as well, persistent
reports came of the banding together of the disaffected people,
and foreign residents in those parts affirmed that they had
never before seen such a state of affairs. One of them was
driven from a country village and threatened with death if he
should ever return. The Korean soldiers who formed the
garrison of Pyeng-yang joined the police in breaking into the
houses of wealthy natives and stealing money and goods.
The authorities remonstrated, but without effect. By the
twentieth of January the tension became so great in Seoul
that a considerable number of the wealthy natives began
removing <a id='corr350.39'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='there families and there valuables'>their families and their valuables</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_350.39'>their families and their valuables</a></span> to the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>About the 20th of January the report circulated that Russia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>had proposed that northern Korea be made a neutral zone
and that Japan exercise predominant influence in the south.
This was only an echo of the negotiations which were nearing
the breaking point in St. Petersburg, and it confirmed
those who knew Japan in their opinion that war alone could
settle the matter. On the following day the Korean Government
issued its proclamation of neutrality as between Russia
and Japan. This curious action, taken before any declaration
of war or any act of hostility, was a pretty demonstration
of Russian tactics. It was evident that in case of war Japan
would be the first in the field and Korea would naturally
be the road by which she would attack Russia. Therefore
while the two were technically at peace with each other
Korea was evidently induced by Russia to put forth a
premature declaration of neutrality in order to anticipate
any use of Korean territory by Japanese troops. At the
time this was done the Foreign Office was shorn of all real
power and was only the mouth-piece through which these
friends of Russia spoke in order to make their pronouncements
official. It was already known that two of the most
powerful Koreans at court had strongly urged that Russia be
asked to send troops to guard the imperial palace in Seoul
and the Japanese were keenly on the lookout for evidences
of bad faith in the matter of this declared neutrality. When,
therefore, they picked up a boat on the Yellow Sea a few
days later and found on it a Korean bearing a letter to Port
Arthur asking for troops, and that, while unofficial in form,
it came from the very officials who had promulgated the
declaration of neutrality, it became abundantly clear that
the spirit of neutrality was non-existent. It must be left to the
future historian to declare whether the Japanese were justified
in impairing a declared neutrality that existed only in name
and under cover of which the Korean officials were proved to
be acting in a manner distinctly hostile to the interests of Japan.</p>

<p class='c000'>All through January the Japanese were busy making
military stations every fifteen miles between Fusan and
Seoul. All along the line small buildings were erected, sufficiently
large to house twenty or thirty men. On January
22nd Gen. Ijichi arrived in Seoul as military attaché of the
Japanese Legation. The appointment of a man of such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>rank as this was most significant and should have aroused
the Russians to a realizing sense of their danger, but it did
not do so. Four days <a id='corr352.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='leter'>later</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_352.3'>later</a></span> this general made a final appeal
to the Korean Government, asking for some definite statement
as to its attitude toward Russia and Japan. The Foreign
Office answered that the government was entirely neutral.
Two days later the Japanese landed a large amount of barley
at the port of Kunsan, a few hours’ run south of Chemulpo,
and a light railway of the Decauville type was also landed
at the same place. On the 29th all Korean students were
recalled from Japan.</p>

<p class='c000'>On February the first the Russians appeared to be the
only ones who did not realize that trouble was brewing,
otherwise why should they have stored 1,500 tons of coal and
a quantity of barley in their godowus on Roze Island in
Chemulpo Harbor on the second of that month? On the
seventh the government received a dispatch from Wiju saying
that <a id='corr352.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='seveal'>several</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_352.18'>several</a></span> thousand Russian troops were approaching
the border and that the Japanese merchants and others were
preparing to retire from that place. The same day the Foreign
Office sent to all the open ports ordering that news should
be immediately telegraphed of any important movements.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the eighth day of February the Japanese posted
notices in Seoul and vicinity that what Japan was about to
do was dictated by motives of right and justice and that the
property and personal rights of Koreans would be respected.
Koreans were urged to report any cases of ill-treatment to
the Japanese authorities and immediate justice was promised.
From this day the port of Chemulpo was practically blockaded
by the Japanese and only by their consent could vessels
enter or clear.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having arrived at the point of actual rupture between
Japan and Russia, it is necessary before entering into any details
of the struggle to indicate the precise bearing of it upon
Korea. Japan has always looked upon Korea as a land whose
political status and affinities are of vital interest to herself;
just as England once looked upon the <em>Cinque</em> ports, namely
as a possible base of hostile action, and therefore to be carefully
watched. One of two things have therefore been deemed
essential, either that Korea should be thoroughly independent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>or that she should be under a Japanese protectorate.
These two ideas have animated different parties in Japan,
and have led to occasional troubles. There is one radical faction
which has consistently and persistently demanded that
Japan’s suzerainty over Korea should be established and
maintained, and it was the unwillingness of the Japanese
authorities to adopt strong measures in the Peninsula which
led to the Satsuma Rebellion. Another large fraction of the
Japanese, of more moderate and rational view, are committed
to the policy of simply holding to the independence of Korea,
arguing very rightly that if such independence is maintained
and the resources of the country are gradually developed Japan
will reap all the material advantages of the situation
without shouldering the burden of the Korean administration
or meeting the violent opposition of the Koreans which such
a step would inevitably entail. It is this latter policy which
has prevailed and according to which Japan has attempted to
work during the past three decades. It is this which actuated
her during the period of China’s active claim to suzerainty
and finally caused the war of 1894 which finally settled
the question of Korea’s independence. But following upon
this came the encroachments of Russia in Manchuria and the
adoption of a vigorous policy in Korea. Japan’s efforts to
preserve the intrinsic autonomy of Korea were rendered
abortive partly through mistakes which her own representatives
and agents made but still more through the supineness
and venality of Korean officials. The subjects of the Czar at
the capital of Korea made use of the most corrupt officials at
court and through them opposed Japanese interests at every
point. Furthermore they made demands for exclusive rights
in different Korean ports and succeeded in encroaching upon
Korean sovereignty in Yongampo. The evident policy
of Russia was to supplant Japan in the peninsula, and no reasonable
person can fail to see that it was their ultimate plan
to add Korea to the map of Russia. The cause of the war
was, therefore, the necessity laid upon Japan of safe-guarding
her vital interests, nay her very existence, by checking the
encroachments of Russia upon Korean territory.</p>

<p class='c000'>But before submitting the matter to the arbitrament of
the sword Japan exerted every effort to make Russia define
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>her intentions in the Far East. With a patience that elicited
the admiration of the world she kept plying Russia with pertinent
questions until at last it was revealed that Russia intended
to deal with Manchuria as she wished and would concede
Japanese interests in Southern Korea, only and even
then only as Japan would engage not to act in that sphere
as Russia was acting in Manchuria.</p>

<p class='c000'>All this time the Japanese people were clamoring for
war. They wanted to get at the throat of their manifest foe;
but their Government, in a masterly way, held them in check,
kept its own secrets so inviolable as to astonish the most astute
diplomatists of the day, and at last, when the hour struck,
she declared for war without having weakened the enthusiasm
of her people and without giving occasion to adverse critics to
say that she had yielded to popular importunity. When she
communicated to Russia her irreducible minimum one would
think that even the blind could see that war was certain to
follow soon. But even then, if there is any truth in direct
evidence, the great majority of the Russians laughed the
matter aside as impossible. The moderation and self-control
of Japan was counted to her for hesitation, so that when the
moment for action came and Japan sprang upon her like a
tigress robbed of her whelps, Russia cried aloud that she had
been wronged. It was on the morning of the seventh that
Baron Rosen’s credentials had been handed back to him in
Tokyo. The evening before this the Japanese Minister had
left St. Petersburg. This in itself was a declaration of war,
but forty hours elapsed before Japan struck the first blow.
During those hours Russia had ample time in which to withdraw
her boats from Chemulpo even though the Japanese refused
to transmit telegrams to Seoul. A fast boat from Port
Arthur could easily have brought the message.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was on the sixth and seventh that reports circulated
in Seoul that the Japanese were landing large bodies of troops
at Kunsan or Asan or both. These rumors turned out to be
false, but beneath them was the fact that a fleet was approaching
Chemulpo. The question has been insistently
asked why the Russian Minister did not inform the commanders
of these Russian vessels and see to it that they were
clear of the harbor before these rumors were realized. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>answer as given is that the Russian Minister had no control
over these boats. They had their orders to remain in Chemulpo
and they must stay. One would think that there would
be at least enough <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em><a id='corr355.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='raport'>rapport</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_355.4'>rapport</a></span></em></span> between the civil and military (or
naval) authorities to use the one in forwarding the interests
of the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even yet the Russians did not appreciate the seriousness
of the situation, but they decided that it was time to send
notice to their authorities in Port Arthur of what was rumored
at Chemulpo. So the small gunboat <em>Koryetz</em> made ready
to move out. Her captain, Belaieff, proposed to the Russian
Consul that the Russian steamship <em>Sungari</em>, which was in
port, should go with the <em>Koryetz</em> and thus enjoy her protection,
but the agent of the company which owned the steamship
strongly objected to her leaving the neutral port at such a
time. He evidently realized in part the acuteness of the situation.
So the <em>Sungari</em> remained at her anchorage and the
<em>Koryetz</em> steamed out of port at two o’clock in the afternoon.
Now, the harbor of Chemulpo is a somewhat peculiar one, for
in one sense it is land-locked and in another it is not. It is
formed by islands between which there are many openings to
the open sea, but most of these are so shallow that ships of
medium draught do not dare attempt them. There is but one
recognized entrance and that is from the southwest, or between
that and the south. This entrance is several miles
wide and in the center of it lies Round Island. When the
<em>Koryetz</em> arrived at the exit of the harbor she suddenly found
herself surrounded by torpedo-boats. The only witnesses of
what occurred at this point are the Japanese and the Russians
and we can only give their accounts. The Russians say that
the Japanese launched four torpedoes at the <em>Koryetz</em> and
when within ten feet of her side they sank. Another statement
is that a shot was fired on board the <em>Koryetz</em> but it was a
mere accident! The Japanese claim that the <em>Koryetz</em> fired
first. If we try to weigh the probabilities it seems impossible
that the torpedoes of the Japanese should have missed
the <em>Koryetz</em> if the torpedo-boats were as near as the Russians
claim. On the other hand the admission on the part of
a single Russian that the first gun was fired on the <em>Koryetz</em>,
even though by accident, is rather damaging, for it is more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>than singular that an accident should have happened at that
precise time. It is a tax on the credulity of the public to
give this lame excuse.</p>

<p class='c000'>In any case it makes little difference who began the
firing. The Japanese had already seized the Russian steamer
<em>Mukden</em> in the harbor of Fusan and the war had begun.
The Japanese doubtless held with Polonius, that <a id='corr356.7'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='if'>“if</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_356.7'>“if</a></span> it is necessary
to fight the man who strikes first and hardest will have
the advantage.” The <em>Koryetz</em> turned back to her anchorage
and the Russians became aware of the extreme precariousness
of their position. Whatever attitude one may take toward the
general situation it is impossible not to extend a large degree
of sympathy to these Russians personally. Through no
fault of their own they were trapped in the harbor and found
too late that they must engage in a hopeless fight in order
to uphold the honor of the Russian flag. But even yet it
was not sure that the neutrality of the port would be ignored
by the Japanese. Lying at anchor among neutral vessels in
a neutral harbor, there was more or less reason to believe
that they were safe for the time being.</p>

<p class='c000'>About four o’clock in the afternoon of February eighth,
which fell on Monday, three Japanese transports entered
Chemulpo harbor from the south, convoyed by cruisers and
torpedo-boats. They seemingly took no notice of the two
Russian boats lying at anchor and were evidently sure that
the Russians would not fire upon the <a id='corr356.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='tansports'>transports</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_356.26'>transports</a></span>. It would be
interesting to know whether the Japanese were relying upon
the declared neutrality of the port in thus venturing or
whether they felt sure that their own superior strength would
keep the Russians still, or whether, again, they were certain
that the Russians had orders not to fire the first gun. But it
is bootless to ask questions that can never be answered. Here
is where the assailant has the advantage. He can choose the
time and method of his attack. We may surmise that had
the Russians divined the intentions of the Japanese and had
foreseen the outcome they would have acted differently, but
divination of Japanese intentions does not seem to be Russia’s
strong point.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the Japanese came to anchor preparations
were made for the immediate landing of the troops, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>cruisers and torpedo-boats, that had convoyed them in, left
the port and joined the fleet outside. This fleet consisted of
six cruisers and several torpedo-boats. The <em>Asama</em> and the
<em>Chiyoda</em> were the most powerful of the cruisers, the former
being nearly half as large again as the <em>Variak</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Night came on, and throughout its long hours the Japanese
troops, by the light of huge fires burning on the jetty,
were landed and marched up into the town. When morning
came everyone was in a state of expectancy. If there was a
Japanese fleet outside they doubtless had other work on
hand than simply watching two Russian boats. Nor could
they leave them behind, for one of them was Russia’s fastest
cruiser and might steam out of the harbor at any time and
destroy Japanese transports. Knowing, as we do now, that
an immediate attack on Port Arthur had been decided upon
we see it was impossible to leave these Russian boats in the
rear. Japan had never recognized the <a id='corr357.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='nuetrality'>neutrality</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_357.17'>neutrality</a></span> of Korea,
for she knew that the declaration was merely a Russian move
to embarrass her, and she never hesitated a moment to break
the thin shell of pretense.</p>

<p class='c000'>About ten o’clock a sealed letter was handed to Captain
Rudnieff of the <em>Variak</em>. It was from the Japanese Admiral
and had been sent through the Russian Consulate. It was
delivered on board the <em>Variak</em> by the hand of Mr. N. Krell, a
Russian resident of the port. This letter informed the Russian
commander that unless both Russian boats should leave
the anchorage and steam out of the bay before twelve o’clock
the Japanese would come in at four o’clock and attack them
where they lay. Captain Rudnieff immediately communicated
the startling intelligence to Captain Belaieff of the <em>Koryetz</em>
and to the commanders of the British, American, French
and Italian war-vessels. We are informed that a conference
of the various commanders took place and that the Russians
were advised to lie where they were. The British commander
was deputed to confer with the Japanese. This was
done by signal and it is said a protest was made against the
proposed violation of neutrality of the port, and that the
neutral boats refused to shift their anchorage. But all complications
of this nature were avoided by the determination
of the Russians to accept the challenge. This they deemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>to be due their flag. It is not improbable that they now foresaw
that the neutrality of the port would not avail them
against the enemy. By remaining at anchor they could
only succeed in involving France, Italy, Great Britain and
the United States, and there would be sure to be those who
would charge the Russians with cowardice. If this was to
begin the war it must at least prove the dauntless courage of
the servants of the Czar. So the commander of the <em>Variak</em>
ordered the decks cleared for action. It has been stated that
he would have preferred to have the <em>Koryetz</em> stay at her
anchorage, for by a quick dash it was just possible that the
swift <em>Variak</em> alone might be able to evade the Japanese
and run the gauntlet successfully. But the commander
of the <em>Koryetz</em> refused to listen to any such proposition.
If the only honor to be gotten out of the affair was by a
desperate attack he was not going to forego his share of
it. He would go out and sink with the <em>Variak</em>. So the
<em>Koryetz</em> also cleared for action. It was done in such haste
that all moveables that were unnecessary were thrown overboard,
a topmast that would not come down in the usual
manner was hewn down with an axe and by half past eleven
the two vessels were ready to go out to their doom. It was
an almost hopeless task—an entirely hopeless one unless the
Japanese should change their minds or should make some
grave mistake, and neither of these things was at all probable.
The Russians were going to certain destruction. Some call
it rashness, not bravery, but they say not well. The boats
were doomed in any case and it was the duty of their officers
and crews to go forth and in dying inflict what injury they
could upon the enemy. To go into battle with chances equal
is the act of a brave man, but to walk into the jaws of death
with nothing but defeat in prospect is the act of a hero, and
the Japanese would be the last to detract from the noble record
that the Russians made. Time has not yet lent its
glamor to this event, we are <a id='corr358.35'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='two'>too</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_358.35'>too</a></span> near it to see it in proper
proportions, but if the six hundred heroes of Balaclava, veterans
of many a fight, gained undying honor for the desperate
charge they made how shall not the future crown these men
who, having never been in action before, made such a gallant
dash at the foe?</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a cloudless but hazy day and from the anchorage
the Japanese fleet was all but invisible, for it lay at least
eight miles out in the entrance of the harbor and partly
concealed by Round Island which splits the offing into two
channels. The two boats made straight for the more easterly
of the channels, their course being a very little west of
south. When they had proceeded about half the distance
from the anchorage to the enemy’s fleet the latter threw a
shot across the bows of each of the Russian boats as a command
to stop and surrender, but the Russians took no notice
of it. The only chance the Russians had to inflict any
damage was to reduce the firing range as much as possible
for the <em>Variak’s</em> guns were only six inches and four-tenths
in caliber and at long range they would have been useless. This
was at five minutes before noon. The Japanese fleet was not
deployed in a line facing the approaching boats and it was
apparent that they did not intend to bring their whole force
to bear upon the Russians simultaneously. We are informed
that only two of the Japanese vessels, the <em>Asama</em> and the
<em>Chiyoda</em>, did the work. It was not long after the warning
shots had been fired that the Japanese let loose and the roar
that went up from those terrible machines of destruction tore
the quiet of the windless bay to tatters and made the houses
of the town tremble where they stood. As the <em>Variak</em>
advanced she swerved to the eastward and gave the Japanese
her starboard broadside. All about her the sea was lashed
into foam by striking shot and almost from the beginning of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>fight her steering-gear was shot away so that she had to
depend on her engines alone for steering. It became evident
to her commander that the passage was impossible.
He had pushed eastward until there was imminent danger
of running aground. So he turned again toward the west
and came around in a curve which brought the <em>Variak</em> much
nearer to the Japanese. It was at this time that the deadly
work was done upon her. Ten of her twelve gun-captains
were shot away. A shell struck her fo’castle, passed between
the arm and body of a gunner who had his hand upon his
hip and, bursting, killed every other man on the fo’castle.
Both bridges were destroyed by bursting shell and the Captain
was seriously wounded in the left arm. The watchers on
shore and on the shipping in the harbor saw flames bursting
out from her quarter-deck and one witness plainly saw shells
drop just beside her and burst beneath the water line. It
was these shots that did the real damage for when, after three
quarters of an hour of steady fighting, she turned her prow
back toward the anchorage it was seen that she had a heavy
list to port which could have been caused only by serious
damage below the water-line. As the two boats came slowly
back to port, the <em>Variak</em> so crippled by the destruction of
one of her engines that she could make only ten knots an
hour, the Japanese boats followed, pouring in a galling fire,
until the Russians had almost reached the anchorage. Then
the pursuers drew back and the battle was over. The
<em>Koryetz</em> was intact. The Japanese had reserved all their fire
for the larger vessel. The <em>Variak</em> was useless as a fighting
machine, for her heavy list to port would probably have
made it impossible to train the guns on the enemy, but all
knew that the end had not yet come. The Russians had
neither sunk nor surrendered. The threat of the Japanese
to come in at four o’clock was still active. As soon as the
<em>Variak</em> dropped anchor the British sent off four hospital
boats to her with a surgeon and a nurse. Other vessels also
sent offers of aid. But it was found that the Russians had
decided to lie at anchor and fight to the bitter end and at
the last moment blow up their vessels with all on board.
What else was there for them to do? They would not surrender
and they could not leave their ships and go ashore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>only to be captured by the enemy. They would play out the
tragedy to a finish and go down fighting. Upon learning
of this determination the commanders of the various neutral
vessels held another conference at which it was decided
that the Russians had done all that was necessary to vindicate
the honor of their flag and that, as it was a neutral port,
the survivors should be invited to seek asylum on the neutral
vessels. The invitation was accepted and the sixty-four
wounded on board the <em>Variak</em> were at once transferred to
the British cruiser <em>Talbot</em> and the French <a id='corr361.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='curiser'>cruiser</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_361.10'>cruiser</a></span> <em>Pascal</em>. As
the commanders of the neutral vessels knew that the <em>Variak</em>
and <em>Koryetz</em> were to be sunk by the Russians they paid no
particular attention to the reiterated statement of the Japanese
that they would enter the harbor at four and finish the
work already begun. The passengers, crew and mails on
board the steamship <em>Sungari</em> had already been transferred to
the <em>Pascal</em> and an attempt had been made to scuttle her but
she was filling very slowly indeed. It was about half-past
three in the afternoon that the officers and crew of the
<em>Koryetz</em> went over the side and on board the <em>Pascal</em>. A train
had been laid by which she would be blown up and it is supposed
that she was entirely abandoned, but some spectators
assert that they saw several men on the forward deck an instant
before the explosion took place.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was generally known throughout the town that the
<em>Koryetz</em> would be blown up before four o’clock and everyone
sought some point of vantage from which to witness the
spectacle. Scores of people went out to the little island on
which the light-house stands, for this was nearest to the
doomed ship. It was thirty-seven minutes past three when
the waiting multitude saw two blinding flashes of light one
following the other in quick succession. A terrific report
followed which dwarfed the roar of cannon to a whisper and
shook every house in the town as if it had been struck by a
solid rock. The window-fastenings of one house at least
were torn off, so great was the concussion. An enormous
cloud of smoke and debris shot toward the sky and at the
same time enveloped the spot where the vessel had lain. A
moment later there began a veritable shower of splintered
wood, torn and twisted railing, books, clothes, rope, utensils
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>and a hundred other belongings of the ship. The cloud of
smoke expanded in the upper air and blotted out the sun like
an eclipse. The startled gulls flew hither and thither as if
dazed by this unheard of phenomenon and men instinctively
raised their hands to protect themselves from the falling
debris, pieces of which were drifted by the upper currents
of air for a distance of three miles landward where they fell
by the hundreds in peoples’ yards.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the smoke was dissipated it was discovered that
the <em>Koryetz</em> had sunk, only her funnel and some torn rigging
appearing above the surface, if we except her forward steel
deck which the force of the explosion had bent up from the
prow so that the point of it, like the share of a huge plow,
stood several feet out of water. The surface of the bay all
about the spot was covered thickly with smoking debris and
several of the ship’s boats were floating about intact upon
the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <em>Variak</em> was left to sink where she lay. The forty-one
dead on board were placed together in a cabin and went
down with her. She burned on till evening and then inclining
more and more to port her funnels finally touched the
water and with a surging, choking groan as of some great
animal in pain she sank. As the water reached the fires a
cloud of steam went up which illuminated by the last flash of
the fire formed her signal of farewell.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was arranged that the British and the French boats
should carry the Russians to a neutral port and guarantee
their parole until the end of the war.</p>

<p class='c000'>This wholly unexpected annihilation of the Russian
boats naturally caused consternation among the Russians of
Chemulpo and Seoul. The Russian Consulate was surrounded
by the Japanese troops and the Consul was held practically
a prisoner. The Japanese Minister in Seoul suggested to the
Russian Minister through the French Legation the advisability
of his removing from Seoul with his nationals, and
every facility was given him for doing this with expedition
and with comfort. A few days later all the Russians were
taken by special train to Chemulpo, and there, being joined
by the Russian subjects in Chemulpo, they all went on board
the <em>Pascal</em>. This vessel must have been crowded, for it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>said that when she sailed she had on board six hundred Russians,
both civilians and military men.</p>

<p class='c000'>Twenty-four of the most desperately wounded men on
board the neutral ships were sent ashore and placed in the
Provisional Red Cross Hospital. For this purpose the English
Church Mission kindly put at the disposal of the Japanese
their hospital at Chemulpo. Several of these wounded
men were suffering from gangrene when they came off the
<em>Pascal</em> but with the most sedulous care the Japanese physicians
and nurses pulled them through.</p>

<p class='c000'>After this battle at Chemulpo there was no more question
about landing Korean troops further down the coast; in
fact as soon as the ice was out of the Tadong River, Chinnampo
became the point of disembarkation. But meanwhile the
troops which had landed at Chemulpo were pushing north by
land as rapidly as circumstances would permit and within a
few weeks of the beginning of the war Pyeng-yang was held
by a strong force of Japanese. At the same time work was
pushed rapidly on the Seoul-Fusan Railway and also begun
on the projected railway line between Seoul and Wiju.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for the Russians they never seriously invaded Korean
territory. Bands of Cossacks crossed the Yalu and scoured
the country right and left but their only serious purpose was
to keep in touch with the enemy and report as to their movements.
On February 28 a small band of Cossacks approached
the north gate of Pyeng Yang and after exchanging a few
shots with the Japanese guard withdrew. This was the first
point at which the two belligerents came in touch with each
other.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was on the night of February 23rd that Korea signed
with Japan a protocol by the terms of which Korea practically
allied herself with Japan and became, as it were, a silent
partner in the war. Korea granted the Japanese the right to
use Korea as a road to Manchuria and engaged to give them
every possible facility for prosecuting the war. On the other
hand Japan guaranteed the independence of Korea and the
safety of the Imperial Family. It is needless to discuss the
degree of spontaneity with which Korea did this. It was a
case of necessity, but if rightly used it might have proved of
immense benefit to Korea, as it surely did to Japan. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>formally did away with the empty husk of neutrality which
had been proclaimed, and made every seaport of the peninsula
belligerent territory, even as it did the land itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>March saw the end of the Peddlars Guild. They had
been organized in Russian interests but now they had no
longer any <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>raison d’etre</em></span>. As a final flurry, one of their number
entered the house of the Foreign Minister with the intent
to murder him, but did not find his victim. Other similar
attempts were made but did not <a id='corr364.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='succed'>succeed</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_364.9'>succeed</a></span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Japanese handled the situation in Seoul with great
circumspection. The notion that they would attack the pro-Russian
officials proved false. Everything was kept quiet
and the perturbation into which the court and the government
were thrown by these startling events was soon soothed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Marquis Ito was sent from Japan with a friendly message
to the Emperor of Korea and this did much to quiet the
unsettled state of things in Korea. At about the same time
the northern ports of Wiju and Yongampo were opened to
foreign trade. This was a natural result of the withdrawal
of Russian influence. It was not long before Yi Yong-ik
who had played such a leading rôle in Korea was invited to
go to Japan and thus an element of unrest was removed from
the field of action. It was believed that the Japanese would
immediately introduce much needed reforms, but it seemed to
be their policy to go very slowly, so slowly in fact that the
better element among the Koreans was disappointed, and got
the impression that Japan was not particularly interested
in the matter of reform. It is probable that the energies
of the Japanese were too much engaged in other <a id='corr364.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='directians'>directions</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_364.29'>directions</a></span>
to divert any to Korea at the time. They had been
complaining bitterly about the monetary conditions, but when
they suddenly stepped into power in Seoul on February 9th
they seemed to forget all about this, for up to the end of 1904
they failed to do anything to correct the vagaries of Korean
finance. But instead of this the Japanese merchants in Korea
and other Japanese who were here for other reasons than
their health immediately began to make requests and demands
for all sorts of privileges. The Board of Trade in
Fusan asked the Japanese government to secure the Maritime
Customs service, permission for extra territorial privileges,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>the establishment of Japanese agricultural stations and other
impossible things.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile the Japanese were steadily pushing north.
At Anju a slight skirmish occurred but there was nothing
that could be called a fight until the Japanese reached the
town of Chöng ju where a small body of Russians took a
stand on a hill northwest of the town and held it for three
hours, but even here the casualties were only about fifteen
on either side. The Russians evidently had no notion of
making a determined stand this side the Yalu. Already, a
week before, the Russian troops had withdrawn from Yongampo
and had crossed to Antung. This fight at Chöng-ju occurred
on March 28th and a week later practically all the
Russian forces had crossed the Yalu and Korea ceased to be
belligerent territory. It is not the province of this history
to follow the Japanese across that historic river and relate
the events which occurred at the beginning of May when the
first great land battle of the war was fought.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole north had been thrown into the greatest confusion
by the presence of these two belligerents. Cossack
bands had scurried about the country, making demands for
food and fodder a part of which they were willing to pay for
with Russian currency quite unknown to the Korean. From
scores of villages and towns the women had fled to the mountain
recesses at a most inclement season, and untold suffering
had been entailed. But these are things that always come in
the track of war and the Koreans bore them as uncomplainingly
as they could. Throughout the whole country the
absorption of the attention of the government in the events of
the war was taken advantage of by robbers, and their raids
were frequent and destructive. As soon as the government
found that the Japanese did not intend to rule with a high
hand it sank back into the former state of selfcomplacent
lethargy, and things went along in the old ruts. It was perfectly
plain that Korean officialdom had no enthusiasm for
the Japanese cause. It is probable that a large majority of
the people preferred to see Japan win rather than the Russians,
but it was the fond wish of ninety-nine out of every
hundred to see Korea rid of them both. Whichever one
held exclusive power here was certain to become an object
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>of hatred to the Korean people. Had the Russians driven out
the Japanese the Koreans would have hated them as heartily.
Whichever horn of the dilemma Korea became impaled
upon she was sure to think the other would have been less
sharp. Few Koreans looked at the matter from any large standpoint
or tried to get from the situation anything but personal
advantage. This is doubtless the reason why it was so difficult
to gain an opinion from Korean officials. They did
not want to go on record as having any decided sympathies
either way. The people of no other land were so nearly
neutral as were those of Korea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The month of April was comparatively quiet. The Japanese
were struggling north through frost and mud combined
to rendezvous on the banks of the Yalu. On the 14th
occurred the great fire in Seoul which in a few hours swept
away almost the whole of the Kyöng-un Palace, the one recently
completed and the one occupied by the Emperor at
the time. He was forced to vacate it in haste and take up
his abode for the time being in the detached Imperial Library
building. A strong effort was made by the Japanese to induce
him to return to the Chöng-dŭk Palace, which was his
place of residence at the time of the <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">emeutes</span></em> of 1882
and 1884, but this was combatted with all the means
available, and the burned palace was rebuilt as quickly as
possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>The temporary effect of the war upon the Korean currency
was to enhance its value. Imports suddenly came to a
standstill because of the lack of steamships and the possible
dangers of navigation. This stopped the demand for yen.
The Japanese army had to spend large sums in Korea and
this required the purchase of Korean money. The result was
that the yen, instead of holding its ratio of something like
one to two and a half of the Korean dollar fell to the ratio of
one to only one and four tenths. When, however, the sea
was cleared of the Russians and import trade was resumed
and the bulk of the Japanese crossed the Yalu the Korean
dollar fell again to a ratio of about two to one, which it has
preserved up to the present time, i.e. December, 1904.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the time when the Russians retired beyond the
Yalu warlike operations between the two belligerents <a id='corr366.39'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='was'>were</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_366.39'>were</a></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>confined to northeast Korea though even there very little
was doing. The Vladivostock squadron was still in being and
on April 25 it appeared at the mouth of Wonsan harbor.
Only one small Japanese boat was at anchor there, the
<em>Goyo Maru</em>, and this was destroyed by a torpedo boat which
came in for the express purpose. Of course this created intense
excitement in the town and there was a hurried exodus
of women and children, but the Russians had no intention
of bombarding the place and soon took their <a id='corr367.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='depature'>departure</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_367.9'>departure</a></span>.
Only a few hours before, the <em>Kinshiu</em>, a Japanese transport
with upwards of 150 troops on board, had sailed for Sŭng-ju
to the north of Wonsan but meeting bad weather in the night
the torpedo-boats that accompanied her were obliged to run
for shelter and the <em>Kinshiu</em> turned back for Wonsan. By
so doing she soon ran into the arms of the Russian fleet and
refusing to surrender she was sunk, but forty-five of the
troops on board effected their escape to the mainland.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was only a few days before this that a force of Cossacks
had made a dash down the eastern coast as far as
Ham-heung which they entered after a two hours’ skirmish
with Korean troops. They burned about 300 houses in the
suburbs of the town and also fourteen <em>kan</em> of the celebrated
“Ten Thousand Year Bridge,” the longest in Korea. After
this they retired to the north. But from that time on the
whole northeast has been scoured by parties of Russians and
the Japanese have paid no attention to them except to place
troops at Wonsan and Ham-heung to hold these places.
On August 8th a small Russian force penetrated south to the
very suburbs of Wonsan but were speedily repulsed by the
Japanese who had thrown up intrenchments and were quite
ready to meet any assault. The Russians worked with great
energy in repairing the road from the Tuman River down to
Sung-su, and even south of that place. They even built
good graded roads across two of the high passes south of
Sung-jin until they came in contact with the Japanese outposts
twenty miles above Ham-heung. Neither side seemed
to desire to assume the offensive and so matters stood until
the end of the year, and the coming of the northern winter
put a stop to active operations. The only other incident
worthy of mention in this connection was the wanton attack
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>upon the town of Wonsan by the Russian fleet on the last
day of June. On that morning seven Russian torpedo-boats
entered the harbor and after inquiring where the Japanese
barracks and other public buildings were situated began
shelling the town. In a panic the peaceful denizens of the
place fled to the shelter of the hills. The Russians gave no
warning of the attack even though many foreigners of various
nationalities resided there and might easily have been injured.
After firing over 200 shells without doing any considerable
damage the torpedo boats withdrew.</p>

<p class='c000'>We must now go back and inquire into important civil
matters. We have seen that no strong attempt was made by
the Japanese to secure reforms in the administration of the
Korean Government and for this reason many of the best
Koreans <a id='corr368.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='weae'>were</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_368.15'>were</a></span> dissatisfied with the way things were going.
Therefore it was doubly unfortunate that on the seventeenth
of June the Japanese authorities should make the startling
suggestion that all uncultivated land in the Peninsula
as well as other national resources should be thrown open to
the Japanese. This appears to have been a scheme evolved
by one Nagamori and broached by him so speciously to the
powers in Tokyo that they backed him in it; but there can
be no question that it was a grave mistake. There is no
other point on which the Korean is so sensitive as upon that
of his land. He is a son of the soil, and agriculture is the
basis of all his institutions. The mere proposal raised an instant
storm of protest from one end of Korea to the other.
The Koreans saw in this move the entering wedge which
would rive the country. It was the beginning of the end.
This excessive show of feeling was not expected by the
Japanese and it is probable that their intentions were by no
means so black as the Koreans pictured them. The very
general terms in which the proposal was worded and the almost
entire lack of limiting particulars gave occasion for all
sorts of wild conjectures and, it must be confessed, left the
door open to very wide constructions. The time was unpropitious,
the method was unfortunate and the subject-matter
of the proposal itself was questionable. The all-important
matter of water supply and control, the difficulties of jurisdiction
on account of the extraterritorial rights implied in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>proposal and other allied questions immediately presented
themselves to the minds of Koreans and they recognized the
fact that the carrying out of this plan would necessarily result
in a Japanese protectorate if not absolute absorption into
the Empire of Japan. The Japanese do not seem to have followed
the logic of the matter to this point or else had not believed
the Koreans capable of doing so. But when the storm
of protest broke it carried everything before it. The Japanese
were not prepared to carry the thing to extremes and after
repeated attempts at a compromise the matter was dropped,
though the Japanese neither withdrew their request nor accepted
the refusal of the Korean Government. It is a matter
of great regret that the Japanese did not quietly and steadily
press the question of internal reforms, and by so doing hasten
the time when the Korean people as a whole would repose
such confidence in the good intentions of the neighbor country
that even such plans as this of the waste lands could be
carried through without serious opposition; for it is quite
sure that there is a large area of fallow land in Korea which
might well be put under the plow.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the weeks when the Japanese were pressing for
a favorable answer to the waste land proposition the Koreans
adopted a characteristic method of opposition. A society
called the <em>Po-an-whe</em> was formed. The name means “Society
for the Promotion of Peace and Safety.” It had
among its membership some of the leading Korean officials.
It held meetings at the cotton guild in the center of Seoul
and a good deal of excited discussion took place as to ways
and means for defeating the purpose of the Japanese. At
the same time memorials by the some poured in upon the
Emperor, beseeching him not to give way to the demands.
The Japanese determined that these forms of opposition must
be put down, so on July the 16th the meeting of the society
was broken in upon by the Japanese police and some of the
leading members were forcibly carried away to the Japanese
police station. Other raids were made upon the society and
more of its members were arrested and its papers confiscated.
The Japanese warned the government that these attempts
to stir up a riot must be put down with a stern hand and demanded
that those who persisted in sending in memorials
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>against the Japanese be arrested and punished. If the Korean
government would not do it the Japanese threatened to
take the law into their own hands. The Japanese troops in
Seoul were augmented until the number was fully 6,000.</p>

<p class='c000'>The agitation was not confined to Seoul, for leading
Koreans sent out circular letters to all the country districts
urging the people to come up to Seoul and make a monster
demonstration which should convince the Japanese that they
were in dead earnest. Many of these letters were suppressed
by the prefects but in spite of this the news spread far
and wide and the society enrolled thousands of members in
every province.</p>

<p class='c000'>The effect of this was seen when, early in August, the
Japanese military authorities asked for the services of 6,000
Korean coolies in the north at handsome wages. The
number was apportioned among different provinces, but the
results were meager. Disaffected persons spread the report
that these coolies would be put on the fighting line, and it
was with the greatest difficulty that two thousand were
secured. There were sanguinary fights in many towns
where attempts were made to force coolies to go against their
will. It was <a id='corr370.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='perfecty'>perfectly</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_370.22'>perfectly</a></span> right for the Japanese to wish to secure
such labor, but the tide of public sentiment was flowing
strong in the other direction because of the attempt to secure
the waste land and because of the suspension of the right of
free speech.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cessation of Japanese efforts to push the waste land
measure did not put an end to agitation throughout the country,
and the Il-chin society continued to carry on its propaganda
until on August 22nd a new society took the field,
named the Il-chin <a id='corr370.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='society'>Society</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_370.31'>Society</a></span>. This was protected by the Japanese
police who allowed only properly accredited members
to enter its doors. This looked as if it were intended as a
counter-move to the Il-chin Society, and as the latter was
having very little success a third society took up the
gauntlet under the name of the Kuk-min or “National People’s”
Society. The platforms promulgated by all these societies
were quite faultless but the institutions had no power
whatever to carry out their laudable plans and so received
only the smiles of the public.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>During the summer the Japanese suggested that it
would be well for Korea to recall her foreign representatives.
The idea was to have Korean diplomatic business abroad
transacted through Japanese legations. Whether this was
a serious attempt or only a feeler put out to get the sense
of the Korean government we are unable to say, but up to
the end of the year the matter was not pushed, and the
nomination by the Japanese of Mr. Stevens, an <a id='corr371.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Amerian'>American</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_371.8'>American</a></span>
subject as adviser to the Foreign Office would seem to indicate
that the existing diplomatic arrangements will be continued
for the time being.</p>

<p class='c000'>The various societies which had been formed as protests
against existing conditions stated some things that ought to
be accomplished but suggested no means by which they could
be done. The difficulty which besets the country is the
lack of general education, and no genuine improvement can
be looked for until the people be educated up to it. For
this reason a number of foreigners joined themselves into
the Educational Association of Korea, their aim being to
provide suitable text books for Korean schools and to help in
other ways toward the solution of the great question. About
the same time the Minister of Education presented the government
with a recommendation that the graduates of the
Government schools be given the preference in the distribution
of public offices. This had no apparent effect upon the
Government at the time, but this is what must come before
students will flock to the Government schools with any
enthusiasm. Later in the year a large number of Koreans
also founded an Educational Society. It made no pretensions
to political significance but went quietly to work gathering
together those who are convinced that the education of
the masses is the one thing needed to put Korea upon her
feet, in the best sense.</p>

<p class='c000'>In September there was celebrated the twentieth anniversary
of the founding of Protestant Christian missions in
Korea. A great convention had been arranged for and leading
men were to attend it but the war <a id='corr371.37'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='interferred'>interfered</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_371.37'>interfered</a></span> with the
plan and the convention was postponed till 1909, when the
quarter-centennial will be celebrated. In spite of this a
memorable meeting was held and the results of <a id='corr371.40'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Chrisitian'>Christian</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_371.40'>Christian</a></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>work in Korea were set forth and discussed. We need say
no more here than that this field is rightly considered as being
one of the most successful in the world and as giving promise
of great things in the future.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the middle of October the Japanese military authorities
sent Marshal Hasegawa to take charge of military affairs
in Korea. He arrived on the thirteenth and shortly after
went to Wonsan to inspect matters in that vicinity. The
news of considerable Russian activity in northeast Korea
seemed to need careful watching and the presence of a general
competent to do whatever was necessary to keep them in
check.</p>

<p class='c000'>The laying of the last rail of the Seoul Fusan-Railway
was an event of great importance to Korea. It adds materially
to the wealth of the country both by forming a means of
rapid communication and by enhancing the value of all the
territory through which it runs. It also gives Japan such a
large vested interest here that it becomes, in a sense, her
guarantee to prevent the country from falling into the hands
of other Powers. But like all good things it has its dangers
as well.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Megata, the new adviser to the Finance Department
arrived in the Autumn and began a close study of Korean
monetary and financial conditions. This was an augury of
good, for Korean finance has always been in a more or less
chaotic condition since the time when the late Regent flooded
the country with discarded Chinese cash and a spurious
Korean coinage whose lack of intrinsic value gave the lie to
its face.</p>

<p class='c000'>Late in the year Mr. Stevens, the newly appointed adviser
of the Foreign Department, took up his duties which,
though less important than those of Mr. Megata, nevertheless
gave assurance that the foreign relations of the government
would be carefully handled.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the year came to a close there were evidences that
the Japanese were about to begin what should have been
begun before, namely a gradual reform in the administration
of the government. Useless offices are to be abolished, the
army is to be brought down to its proper proportions, retrenchment
is to be effected in various other lines and education
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>is to be encouraged. On the whole the year closed with
brighter prospects in Korea than any former portion of the
year had shown.</p>

<p class='c000'>The termination of an historical survey covering four
thousand years of time naturally suggests some general remarks
upon that history as a whole. And in the first place
it is worth noting that the Korean people became a homogeneous
nation at a very early date. Before the opening of
the tenth century they were so firmly welded together that
no sectional difference has ever seriously threatened their
disruption.</p>

<p class='c000'>Since the year 700 A. D. there have been two bloodless
changes of dynasty but there has not been a single successful
revolution, in the ordinary sense of the word. There have
been three great and several small invasions but none of these
left any serious marks upon the country either in the line of
inter-mixture of blood or of linguistic modification. They
served simply to weld the people more closely together and
make the commonwealth more homogeneous than ever.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the second place the power has always been in the
hands of the men of greatest average wit, and it has uniformly
been used to further personal aims. The idea of any altruistic
service has been conspicuously lacking, though there
have been brilliant exceptions. The concept of individuality
or personality is strangely lacking in all Turanian peoples
and this it is which has kept them so far in the rear of the
Indo-European peoples in the matter of civilization. The essential
feature of true progress, namely the recognition of
the present time as on the whole the best time, the present
institutions as being the best institution, the present opportunities
as being the best opportunities, the present people
as being the best people that history has to show—this
feature is sadly lacking in the Far East. Japan has grafted
this into her life and it already bears fruit, but Korea stands
with China as yet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Individual people cannot be sure of getting their just
deserts in this life whether they be good or evil, but this is
hardly true of nations. They generally get about what they
have deserved. If men lived as long as empires they too
might be served the same. It is poor philosophy to mourn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>the fate of a decadent empire or a moribund civilization.
They have served their <a id='corr374.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='purposed'>purposes</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_374.2'>purposes</a></span> and are ready to pass away.
Upon their ruins there are sure to arise edifices that are
worthier of habitation than were those of the past. In Korea
the old is passing away, is crumbling about our ears. The
new wine is bursting the old bottles. The question for the
future to answer is whether the Korean people will allow
their ship of state to drift upon the <a id='corr374.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Sarasso'>Sargasso</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_374.8'>Sargasso</a></span> Sea until the
seaweed “rising strake on strake” shall make her utterly
derilict, or whether they will awake from their lethargy,
clear away the barnacles and jam the helm down hard a-port
until the wind fills the sails and she can forge ahead toward
some desired haven.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not the province of the historian to play the prophet
nor shall we try to forecast what the future may bring
forth, but it is permissible to express the hope that Korea
will make herself increasingly worthy of a continued and
distinguished history.</p>

<p class='c000'>The use of digital editions is greatly enhanced through the use of
text search features. That usefulness can be stymied by variations,
intentional or not, in spelling. The decision was taken here to attempt
to regularize spelling where printer or editorial errors were made,
or where there seemed to be gratuitous variations. Unfortunately,
there were many such errors, both in this volume and in the first.</p>

<p class='c000'>For errors in the English text, corrections were made where they could
be reasonably attributed to the printer or editor, or where the same
English word appears as expected elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>One cannot determine a ‘correct’ printing of Korean, Chinese or Japanese proper
or place names. The romanization of Korean words was changing even as this
text was being prepared in the early 20th century. The author notes (Vol I, p. <a href='http://www.gutenberg.org/files/52127/52127-h/52127-h.htm#Page_iv'>iv</a>)
that a system of his own was adopted during the preparation of this text,
but a more official system issued by the Royal Asiatic Society was employed
later. The result, as he says, is that there are inconsistencies in the
spelling of proper names. Sometimes variations can appear on a single page
or paragraph. Since it is impossible to distinquish between printer lapses
and this variability, proper names are generally given here as they appeared
in the text.</p>

<p class='c000'>Exceptions are made where frequently used names (e.g., ‘Ko-gu-ryŭ’) very occasionally
appear in other forms.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where the quality of the source text is suspect, the most common version
of a given name is used. Hyphenation can be very difficult to discern, with the
inking sometimes being vestigial.</p>

<p class='c000'>The system in use in this volume for Korean seems to solely employ ‘ŭ’ and ‘ă’,
except for the occasional ‘oé’ or ‘ö’. On rare occasions, ‘ŭ’ will appear
to be printed with the diaeresis ‘ü’, which is most likely a poorly inked breve.
There are also transliterations for Japanese and Manchu which may include ‘ŏ’
and ‘ă’. Many names appear in the text with or without diacritical marks, with
alternate transliterations, e.g. ‘gwi’, ‘kwi’ or ‘guei’, and with or without
hyphenation. A good example appears on pp. <a href='#Page_252'>252</a> and <a href='#Page_259'>259</a>, where the name of a
Chinese war-ship appears as ‘Kwang-chia’, ‘Kwan-chia’, ‘Kwang-yi’, ‘Kwang-ki’.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another exception is made for the (presumable) misprinting of proper
names, which, according to the author’s <a href='http://www.gutenberg.org/files/52127/52127-h/52127-h.htm#Page_iv'>Preface</a> to Volume I, have no hyphen between
the patronymic and the following given names, which are hyphenated. Where this
rule is violated, the hyphen is removed. Where a hyphen occurs at the end of a line,
it is retained or removed depending on the preponderance of other instances of the
same word.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is no mention by the author regarding the use of the special characters
‘ and ’ within Korean names. More modern romanization schemes simply utilize the
apostrophe (’) to indicate aspirated consonants (p’, t’, k’, and Ch’).
In this text, however, though the place-name ‘P<span class='large'>‘</span>yŭng-yang’ can be found much more
frequently than ‘P<span class='large'>’</span>yŭng-yang’, there seems to be no rhyme nor reason
to the variations. Both will occasionally appear in different words on the
same page. Every attempt was made to follow the text.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second chapter of this volume was inadvertently headed as Chapter XI,
and is referred to here as Chapter I-A. Also, the heading of Chapter X
was misprinted as XX.</p>

<p class='c000'>The author consistently uses the word ‘geurilla’, where modern usage would
have us using ‘guerrilla’ or ‘guerilla’, and that has been honored here. Other words
which are consistently spelled oddly (e.g. ‘preceeding’, ‘peddlar’, ‘interferance’)
are retained.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are three indexes: a General Index, a Biographical Index, and a Chronological
Index, which features (with one exception) the only Korean characters in the volume.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Indexes, particularly the biographical index, a different style of
Romanization was employed, which almost entirely dispenses with hyphenation
and diacritical marks.</p>

<p class='c000'>The page references to both volumes are unreliable, sometimes indicating
the precise page where the subject is first mentioned, and sometimes indicating
the first page of the chapter where that mention occurs.</p>

<p class='c000'>A number of page references were missing or obviously corrupt, and have been added
or replaced, where the reference is warranted by the text. Those which simply reference
the wrong locations have been retained. On several occasions, dates were misinterpretted
as volume and page references, e.g., ‘1420’ became ‘I 420’ and ‘1592’ become ‘I 592’.
These have been corrected. The following table mentions these corrections:</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
